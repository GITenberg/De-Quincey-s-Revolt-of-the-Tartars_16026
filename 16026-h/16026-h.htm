<p>In editing an English classic for use in the secondary schools, there
is always opportunity for the expression of personal convictions and
personal taste; nevertheless, where one has predecessors in the task
of preparing such a text, it is difficult always, occasionally
impossible, to avoid treading on their heels. The present editor,
therefore, hastens to acknowledge his indebtedness to the various
school editions of the <i>Revolt of the Tartars</i>, already in existence.
The notes by Masson are so authoritative and so essential that their
quotation needs no comment. De Quincey's footnotes are retained in
their original form and appear embodied in the text. The other
annotations suggest the method which the editor would follow in
class-room work upon this essay.</p>

<p>The student's attention is called frequently to the <i>form</i> of
expression; the discriminating use of epithets, the employment of
foreign phrases, the allusions to Milton and the Bible, the structure
of paragraphs, the treatment of incident, the development of feeling,
the impressiveness of a present personality; all this, however, is
with the purpose, not of mechanic exercise, nor merely to illustrate
"rhetoric," but to illuminate <i>De Quincey</i>. It is with this intention,
presumably, that the text is prescribed. There is little
attractiveness, after all, in the idea of a style so colorless and so
impersonal that the individuality of its victim is lost in its own
perfection; this was certainly not the Opium-Eater's mind concerning
literary form, nor does it appear to have been the <!-- Page -19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-19" id="Page_-19">Page v</a></span>aim of any of our
masters. Indeed, it may be well in passing to point out to pupils how
fatal to success in writing is the attempt to imitate the style of any
man, De Quincey included; it is always in order to emphasize the
naturalness and spontaneity of the "grand style" wherever it is found.
The teacher should not inculcate a blind admiration of all that De
Quincey has said or done; there is opportunity, even in this brief
essay, to exercise the pupil in applying the commonplace tests of
criticism, although it should be seen to as well that a true
appreciation is awakened for the real excellences of this little
masterpiece.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Thomas De Quincey is one of the eccentric figures in English
literature. Popularly he is known as the English Opium-Eater and as
the subject of numerous anecdotes which emphasize the oddities of his
temperament and the unconventionality of his habits. That this man of
distinguished genius was the victim&mdash;pitifully the victim&mdash;of opium is
the lamentable fact; that he was morbidly shy and shunned intercourse
with all except a few intimate, congenial friends; that he was
comically indifferent to the fashion of his dress; that he was the
most unpractical and childlike of men; that he was often betrayed,
because of these peculiarities, into many ridiculous embarrassments,
such as are described by Mr. Findlay, Mr. Hogg, and Mr. Burton,&mdash;of
all this there can be no doubt; but these idiosyncrasies are, after
all, of minor importance, the accidents, not the essentials in the
life and personality of this remarkable man. The points that should
attract our notice, the qualities that really give distinction to De
Quincey, are the broad sweep of his knowledge, almost unlimited in its
scope and singularly accurate in its details, a facility of phrasing
and a word supply that transformed the mere power of discriminating
expression into a fine art, and a style that, while it lapsed
occasionally from the standard of its own excellence, was generally
self-corrective and frequently forsook the levels of commonplace
excellence for the highest reaches of impassioned prose. Nor is this
all. His pages do not lack in humor&mdash;humor of the truest and most
delicate type; and if De Quincey is at <!-- Page -16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-16" id="Page_-16">Page viii</a></span>times impelled beyond the
bounds of taste, even these excursions demonstrate his power, at least
in handling the grotesque. His sympathies, however, are always
genuine, and often are profound. The pages of his autobiographic
essays reveal the strength of his affections, while in the
interpretation of such a character as that of Joan of Arc, or in
allusions like those to the pariahs,&mdash;defenceless outcasts from
society, by whose wretched lot his heart was often wrung,&mdash;he writes
in truest pathos.</p>

<p>Now sympathy is own child of the imagination, whether expressed in the
language of laughter or in the vernacular of tears; and the most
distinctive quality in the mental make-up of De Quincey was, after
all, this dominant imagination which was characteristic of the man
from childhood to old age. The Opium-Eater once defined the <i>great
scholar</i> as "not one who depends simply on an infinite memory, but
also on an infinite and electrical power of combination, bringing
together from the four winds, like the angel of the resurrection, what
else were dust from dead men's bones, into the unity of breathing
life." Such was De Quincey himself. He was a scholar born, gifted with
a mind apt for the subtleties of metaphysics, a memory well-nigh
inexhaustible in the recovery of facts; in one respect, at least, he
was a <i>great</i> scholar, for his mind was dominated by an imagination as
vigorous as that which created Macaulay's <i>England</i>, almost as
sensitive to dramatic effect as that which painted Carlyle's <i>French
Revolution</i>. Therefore when he wrote narrative, historical narrative,
or reminiscence, he lived in the experiences he pictured, as great
historians do; perhaps living over again the scenes of the past, or
for the first time making real the details of occurrences with which
he was only recently familiar.</p>

<p>The <i>Revolt of the Tartars</i> is a good illustration of his power.
Attracted by the chance reading of an obscure
<!-- Page -15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-15" id="Page_-15">Page ix</a></span>
French missionary and
traveller to the dramatic possibilities of an episode in Russian
history, De Quincey built from the bare notes thus discovered,
supplemented by others drawn from a matter-of-fact German
arch&aelig;ologist, a narrative which for vividness of detail and
truthfulness of local color belongs among the best of those classics
in which fancy helps to illuminate fact, and where the imagination is
invoked to recreate what one feels intuitively must have been real.</p>

<p>The <i>Revolt of the Tartars</i>, while not exhibiting the highest
achievement of the author's power, nevertheless belongs in the group
of writings wherein his peculiar excellences are fairly manifested.
The obvious quality of its realism has been pointed out already; the
masterly use of the principles of suspense and stimulated interest
will hardly pass unnoticed. A negative excellence is the absence of
that discursiveness in composition, that tendency to digress into
superfluous comment, which is this author's one prevailing fault. De
Quincey was gifted with a fine appreciation of harmonious sound, and
in those passages where his spirit soars highest not the least of
their beauties is found in the melodiousness of their tone and the
rhythmic sweetness of their motion.</p>

<p>It is as a master of rhetoric that De Quincey is distinguished among
writers. Some hints of his ability are seen in the opening and closing
passages of this essay, but to find him at his best one must turn to
the <i>Confessions</i> and to the other papers which describe his life,
particularly those which recount his marvellous dreams. In these
papers we find the passages where De Quincey's passion rises to the
heights which few other writers have ever reached in prose, a
loftiness and grandeur which is technically denominated as "sublime."
In his <i>Essay on Style</i>, published in <i>Blackwood's</i>, 1840, he
deprecates the usual indifference to form, on the part of English
writers, "the tendency of the national <!-- Page -14 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-14" id="Page_-14">Page x</a></span>mind to value the matter of a
book not only as paramount to the manner, but even as distinct from it
and as capable of a separate insulation." As one of the great masters
of prose style in this century, De Quincey has so served the interests
of art in this regard, that in his own case the charge is sometimes
reversed: his own works are read rather to observe his manner than to
absorb his thought. Yet when this is said, it is not to imply that the
material is unworthy or the ideas unsound; on the contrary, his
sentiment is true and his ideas are wholesome; but many of the topics
treated lie outside the deeper interests of ordinary life, and fail to
appeal to us so practically as do the writings of some lesser men. Of
the "one hundred and fifty magazine articles" which comprise his
works, there are many that will not claim the general interest, yet
his writings as a whole will always be recognized by students of
rhetoric as containing excellences which place their author among the
English classics. Nor can De Quincey be accused of subordinating
matter to manner; in spite of his taste for the theatrical and a
tendency to extravagance, his expression is in keeping with his
thought, and the material of those passages which contain his most
splendid flights is appropriate to the treatment it receives. One
effective reason, certainly, why we take pleasure in the mere style of
De Quincey's work is because that work is so thoroughly inspired with
the Opium-Eater's own genial personality, because it so unmistakably
suggests that inevitable "smack of individuality" which gives to the
productions of all great authors their truest distinction if not their
greatest worth.</p><a name="BIO" id="BIO"></a>

<p>Thomas De Quincey was born in Manchester, August 15, 1785. His father
was a well-to-do merchant of literary taste, but of him the children
of the household scarcely knew; he was an invalid, a prey to
consumption, and during their <!-- Page -13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-13" id="Page_-13">Page xi</a></span>childhood made his residence mostly in
the milder climate of Lisbon or the West Indies. Thomas was seven
years old when his father was brought home to die, and the lad, though
sensitively impressed by the event, felt little of the significance of
relationship between them. Mrs. De Quincey was a somewhat stately
lady, rather strict in discipline and rigid in her views. There does
not seem to have been the most complete sympathy between mother and
son, yet De Quincey was always reverent in his attitude, and certainly
entertained a genuine respect for her intelligence and character.
There were eight children in the home, four sons and four daughters;
Thomas was the fifth in age, and his relations to the other members of
this little community are set forth most interestingly in the opening
chapters of his <i>Autobiographic Sketches</i>.</p>

<p>De Quincey's child life was spent in the country; first at a pretty
rustic dwelling known as "The Farm," and after 1792 at a larger
country house near Manchester, built by his father, and given by his
mother the pleasantly suggestive name of "Greenhay," <i>hay</i> meaning
hedge, or hedgerow. The early boyhood of Thomas De Quincey is of more
than ordinary interest, because of the clear light it throws upon the
peculiar temperament and endowments of the man. Moreover, we have the
best of authority in our study of this period, namely, the author
himself, who in the <i>Sketches</i> already mentioned, and in his most
noted work, <i>The Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>, has told the
story of these early years in considerable detail and with apparent
sincerity. De Quincey was not a sturdy boy. Shy and dreamy,
exquisitely sensitive to impressions of melancholy and mystery, he was
endowed with an imagination abnormally active even for a child. It is
customary to give prominence to De Quincey's pernicious habit of
opium-eating, in attempting to explain the grotesque fancies and weird
flights of his <!-- Page -12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-12" id="Page_-12">Page xii</a></span>marvellous mind in later years; yet it is only fair to
emphasize the fact that the later achievements of that strange
creative faculty were clearly foreshadowed in youth. For example, the
earliest incident in his life that he could afterwards recall, he
describes as "a remarkable dream of terrific grandeur about a favorite
nurse, which is interesting to myself for this reason&mdash;that it
demonstrates my dreaming tendencies to have been constitutional, and
not dependent upon laudanum."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Again he tells us how, when six years
old, upon the death of a favorite sister three years older, he stole
unobserved upstairs to the death chamber; unlocking the door and
entering silently, he stood for a moment gazing through the open
window toward the bright sunlight of a cloudless day, then turned to
behold the angel face upon the pillow. Awed in the presence of death,
the meaning of which he began vaguely to understand, he stood
listening to a "solemn wind" that began to blow&mdash;"the saddest that ear
ever heard." What followed should appear in De Quincey's own words: "A
vault seemed to open in the zenith of the far blue sky, a shaft which
ran up forever. I, in spirit, rose as if on billows that also ran up
the shaft forever; and the billows seemed to pursue the throne of God;
but <i>that</i> also ran on before us and fled away continually. The flight
and the pursuit seemed to go on forever and ever. Frost gathering
frost, some sarsar wind of death, seemed to repel me; some mighty
relation between God and death dimly struggled to evolve itself from
the dreadful antagonism between them; shadowy meanings even yet
continued to exercise and torment, in dreams, the deciphering oracle
within me. I slept&mdash;for how long I cannot say: slowly I recovered my
self-possession; and, when I woke, found myself standing as before,
close to my sister's bed."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Somewhat
<!-- Page -11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-11" id="Page_-11">Page xiii</a></span>
similar in effect were the
fancies that came to this dreamy boy on Sunday mornings during service
in the fine old English church. Through the wide central field of
uncolored glass, set in a rich framework of gorgeous color,&mdash;for the
side panes of the great windows were pictured with the stories of
saints and martyrs,&mdash;the lad saw "white fleecy clouds sailing over the
azure depths of the sky." Straightway the picture changed in his
imagination, and visions of young children, lying on white beds of
sickness and of death, rose before his eyes, ascending slowly and
softly into heaven, God's arms descending from the heavens that He
might the sooner take them to Himself and grant release. Such are not
infrequently the dreams of children. De Quincey's experience is not
unique; but with him imagination, the imagination of childhood,
remained unimpaired through life. It was not wholly opium that made
him the great dreamer of our literature, any more than it was the
effect of a drug that brought from his dying lips the cry of "Sister,
sister, sister!"&mdash;an echo from this sacred chamber of death, where he
had stood awed and entranced nearly seventy years before.</p>

<p>Not all of De Quincey's boyhood, however, was passed under influences
so serious and mystical as these. He was early compelled to undergo
what he is pleased to call his "introduction to the world of strife."
His brother William, five years the senior of Thomas, appears to have
been endowed with an imagination as remarkable as his own. "His genius
for mischief," says Thomas, "amounted to inspiration." Very amusing
are the chronicles of the little autocracy thus despotized by William.
The assumption of the young tyrant was magnificent. Along with the
prerogatives and privileges of seniority, he took upon himself as well
certain responsibilities more galling to his half-dozen uneasy
subordinates, doubtless, than the undisputed hereditary rights
<!-- Page -10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-10" id="Page_-10">Page xiv</a></span>of
age. William constituted himself the educational guide of the nursery,
proclaiming theories, delivering lectures, performing experiments,
asserting opinions upon subjects diverse and erudite. Indeed, a
vigorous spirit was housed in William's body, and but for his early
death, this lad also might have brought lustre to the family name.</p>

<p>A real introduction to the world of strife came with the development
of a lively feud between the two brothers on the one side, and on the
other a crowd of young belligerents employed in a cotton factory on
the road between Greenhay and Manchester, where the boys now attended
school. Active hostilities occurred daily when the two "aristocrats"
passed the factory on their way home at the hour when its inmates
emerged from their labor. The dread of this encounter hung like a
cloud over Thomas, yet he followed William loyally, and served with
all the spirit of a cadet of the house. Imagination played an
important part in this campaign, and it is for that reason primarily
that to this and the other incidents of De Quincey's childhood
prominence is here given; in no better way can we come to an
understanding of the real nature of this singular man.</p>

<p>In 1796 the home at Greenhay was broken up. The irrepressible William
was sent to London to study art; Mrs. De Quincey removed to Bath, and
Thomas was placed in the grammar school of that town; a younger
brother, Richard, in all respects a pleasing contrast to William, was
a sympathetic comrade and schoolmate. For two years De Quincey
remained in this school, achieving a great reputation in the study of
Latin, and living a congenial, comfortable life. This was followed by
a year in a private school at Winkfield, which was terminated by an
invitation to travel in Ireland with young Lord Westport, a lad of De
Quincey's own age, an intimacy having sprung up between them a year
earlier at Bath. It was in 1800 that the trip was made, and the
<!-- Page -9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-9" id="Page_-9">Page xv</a></span>period of the visit extended over four or five months. After this
long recess De Quincey was placed in the grammar school at Manchester,
his guardians expecting that a three years' course in this school
would bring him a scholarship at Oxford. However, the new environment
proved wholly uncongenial, and the sensitive boy who, in spite of his
shyness and his slender frame, possessed grit in abundance, and who
was through life more or less a law to himself, made up his mind to
run away. His flight was significant. Early on a July morning he
slipped quietly off&mdash;in one pocket a copy of an English poet, a volume
of Euripides in the other. His first move was toward Chester, the
seventeen-year-old runaway deeming it proper that he should report at
once to his mother, who was now living in that town. So he trudged
overland forty miles and faced his astonished and indignant parent. At
the suggestion of a kind-hearted uncle, just home from India, Thomas
was let off easily; indeed, he was given an allowance of a guinea a
week, with permission to go on a tramp through North Wales, a
proposition which he hailed with delight. The next three months were
spent in a rather pleasant ramble, although the weekly allowance was
scarcely sufficient to supply all the comforts desired. The trip ended
strangely. Some sudden fancy seizing him, the boy broke off all
connection with his friends and went to London. Unknown, unprovided
for, he buried himself in the vast life of the metropolis. He lived a
precarious existence for several months, suffering from exposure,
reduced to the verge of starvation, his whereabouts a mystery to his
friends. The cloud of this experience hung darkly over his spirit,
even in later manhood; perceptions of a true world of strife were
vivid; impressions of these wretched months formed the material of his
most sombre dreams.</p>

<p>Rescued at last, providentially, De Quincey spent the next period of
his life, covering the years 1803-7, in residence <!-- Page -8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-8" id="Page_-8">Page xvi</a></span>at Oxford. His
career as a student at the university is obscure. He was a member of
Worcester College, was known as a quiet, studious man, and lived an
isolated if not a solitary life. With a German student, who taught him
Hebrew, De Quincey seems to have had some intimacy, but his circle of
acquaintance was small, and no contemporary has thrown much light on
his stay. In 1807 he disappeared from Oxford, having taken the written
tests for his degree, but failing to present himself for the necessary
oral examination.</p>

<p>The year of his departure from Oxford brought to De Quincey a
long-coveted pleasure&mdash;acquaintance with two famous contemporaries
whom he greatly admired, Coleridge and Wordsworth. Characteristic of
De Quincey in many ways was his gift, anonymously made, of &pound;300 to his
hero, Coleridge. This was in 1807, when De Quincey was twenty-two, and
was master of his inheritance. The acquaintance ripened into intimacy,
and in 1809 the young man, himself gifted with talents which were to
make him equally famous with these, took up his residence at Grasmere,
in the Lake country, occupying for many years the cottage which
Wordsworth had given up on his removal to ampler quarters at Rydal
Mount. Here he spent much of his time in the society of the men who
were then grouped in distinguished neighborhood; besides Wordsworth
and Coleridge, the poet Southey was accessible, and a frequent visitor
was John Wilson, later widely known as the "Christopher North" of
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>. Nor was De Quincey idle; his habits of study
were confirmed; indeed, he was already a philosopher at twenty-four.
These were years of hard reading and industrious thought, wherein he
accumulated much of that metaphysical wisdom which was afterward to
win admiring recognition.</p>

<p>In 1816 De Quincey married Margaret Simpson, a farmer's daughter
living near. There is a pretty scene painted by <!-- Page -7 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-7" id="Page_-7">Page xvii</a></span>the author
himself,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in which he gives us a glimpse of his domestic life at
this time. Therein he pictures the cottage, standing in a valley,
eighteen miles from any town; no spacious valley, but about two miles
long by three-quarters of a mile in average width. The mountains are
real mountains, between 3000 and 4000 feet high, and the cottage a
real cottage, white, embowered with flowering shrubs, so chosen as to
unfold a succession of flowers upon the walls, and clustering around
the windows, through all the months of spring, summer, and autumn,
beginning, in fact, with May roses and ending with jasmine. It is in
the winter season, however, that De Quincey paints his picture, and so
he describes a room, seventeen feet by twelve, and not more than seven
and one-half feet high. This is the drawing-room, although it might
more justly be termed the library, for it happens that books are the
one form of property in which the owner is wealthy. Of these he has
about 5000, collected gradually since his eighteenth year. The room
is, therefore, populous with books. There is a good fire on the
hearth. The furniture is plain and modest, befitting the unpretending
cottage of a scholar. Near the fire stands a tea table; there are only
two cups and saucers on the tray. It is an "eternal" teapot that the
artist would like us to imagine, for he usually drinks tea from eight
o'clock at night to four in the morning. There is, of course, a
companion at the tea table, and very lovingly does the husband suggest
the pleasant personality of his young wife. One other important
feature is included in the scene; upon the table there rests also a
decanter, in which sparkles the ruby-colored laudanum.</p>

<p>De Quincey's experience with opium had begun while he was a student at
the university, in 1804. It was first taken to obtain relief from
neuralgia, and his use of the drug did not at once become habitual.
During the period of residence <!-- Page -6 --><span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_-6" id="Page_-6">Page xviii</a></span>at Grasmere, however, De Quincey
became confirmed in the habit, and so thoroughly was he its victim
that for a season his intellectual powers were well-nigh paralyzed;
his mind sank under such a cloud of depression and gloom that his
condition was pitiful in the extreme. Just before his marriage, in
1816, De Quincey, by a vigorous effort, partially regained his
self-control and succeeded in materially reducing his daily allowance
of the drug; but in the following year he fell more deeply than ever
under its baneful power, until in 1818-19 his consumption of opium was
something almost incredible. Thus he became truly enough the great
English Opium-Eater, whose Confessions were later to fill a unique
place in English literature. It was finally the absolute need of
bettering his financial condition that compelled De Quincey to shake
off the shackles of his vice; this he practically accomplished,
although perhaps he was never entirely free from the habit. The event
is coincident with the beginning of his career as a public writer. In
1820 he became a man of letters.</p>

<p>As a professional writer it is to be noted that De Quincey was
throughout a contributor to the periodicals. With one or two
exceptions all his works found their way to the public through the
pages of the magazines, and he was associated as contributor with most
of those that were prominent in his time. From 1821 to 1825 we find
him residing for the most part in London, and here his public career
began. It was De Quincey's most distinctive work which first appeared.
The <i>London Magazine</i>, in its issue for September, 1821, contained the
first paper of the <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>. The
novelty of the subject was sufficient to obtain for the new writer an
interested hearing, and there was much discussion as to whether his
apparent frankness was genuine or assumed. All united in applause of
the masterly style which distinguished the essay, also of the
profundity and <!-- Page -5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-5" id="Page_-5">Page xix</a></span>
value of the interesting material it contained. A
second part was included in the magazine for October. Other articles
by the Opium-Eater followed, in which the wide scholarship of the
author was abundantly shown, although the topics were of less general
interest.</p>

<p>In 1826 De Quincey became an occasional contributor to <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i>, and this connection drew him to Edinburgh, where he
remained, either in the city itself or in its vicinity, for the rest
of his life. The grotesquely humorous <i>Essay on Murder Considered as
One of the Fine Arts</i> appeared in <i>Blackwood's</i> in 1827. In 1832 he
published a series of articles on Roman History, entitled <i>The
C&aelig;sars</i>. It was in July, 1837, that the <i>Revolt of the Tartars</i>
appeared; in 1840 his critical paper upon <i>The Essenes</i>. Meanwhile De
Quincey had begun contributions to <i>Tait's Magazine</i>, another
Edinburgh publication, and it was in that periodical that the
<i>Sketches of Life and Manners from the Autobiography of an English
Opium-Eater</i> began to appear in 1834, running on through several
years. These sketches include the chapters on Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Lamb, and Southey as well as those <i>Autobiographic Sketches</i> which
form such a charming and illuminating portion of his complete works.</p>

<p>The family life was sadly broken in 1837 by the death of De Quincey's
wife. He who was now left as guardian of the little household of six
children, was himself so helpless in all practical matters that it
seemed as though he were in their childish care rather than protector
of them. Scores of anecdotes are related of his odd and unpractical
behavior. One of his curious habits had been the multiplication of
lodgings; as books and manuscripts accumulated about him so that there
remained room for no more, he would turn the key upon his possessions
and migrate elsewhere to repeat the performance later on. It is known
that as many as four separate rents were at one and the same time
being paid by <!-- Page -4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-4" id="Page_-4">Page xx</a></span>
this odd, shy little man, rather than allow the
disturbance or contraction of his domain. Sometimes an anxious journey
in search of a manuscript had to be made by author and publisher in
conjunction before the missing paper could be located. The home life
of this eccentric yet lovable man of genius seems to have been always
affectionate and tender in spite even of his bondage to opium; it was
especially beautiful and childlike in his latest years. His eldest
daughter, Margaret, assumed quietly the place of headship, and with a
discretion equal to her devotion she watched over her father's
welfare. With reference to De Quincey's circumstances at this time,
his biographer, Mr. Masson, says: "Very soon, if left to himself, he
would have taken possession of every room in the house, one after
another, and 'snowed up' each with his papers; but, that having been
gently prevented, he had one room to work in all day and all night to
his heart's content. The evenings, or the intervals between his daily
working time and his nightly working time, or stroll, he generally
spent in the drawing-room with his daughters, either alone or in
company with any friends that chanced to be with him. At such times,
we are told, he was unusually charming. 'The newspaper was brought
out, and he, telling in his own delightful way, rather than reading,
the news, would, on questions from this one or that one of the party,
often including young friends of his children, neighbors, or visitors
from distant places, illuminate the subject with such a wealth of
memories, of old stories of past or present experiences, of humor, of
suggestion, even of prophecy, as by its very wealth makes it
impossible to give any taste of it.' The description is by one of his
daughters; and she adds a touch which is inimitable in its fidelity
and tenderness. 'He was not,' she says, 'a reassuring man for nervous
people to live with, as those nights were exceptional on which he did
not set something <!-- Page -3 --><span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_-3" id="Page_-3">Page xxi</a></span>on fire, the commonest incident being for some one
to look up from book or work, to say casually, <i>Papa, your hair is on
fire</i>; of which a calm <i>Is it, my love?</i> and a hand rubbing out the
blaze was all the notice taken.'"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Of his personal appearance Professor Minto says:</p>

<p>"He was a slender little man, with small, clearly chiselled features,
a large head, and a remarkably high, square forehead. There was a
peculiarly high and regular arch in the wrinkles of his brow, which
was also slightly contracted. The lines of his countenance fell
naturally into an expression of mild suffering, of endurance sweetened
by benevolence, or, according to the fancy of the interpreter, of
gentle, melancholy sweetness. All that met him seem to have been
struck with the measured, silvery, yet somewhat hollow and unearthly
tones of his voice, the more impressive that the flow of his talk was
unhesitating and unbroken."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The literary labors were continuous. In 1845 the beautiful <i>Suspiria
de Profundis</i> (Sighs from the Depths) appeared in <i>Blackwood's</i>; <i>The
English Mail Coach</i> and <i>The Vision of Sudden Death</i>, in 1849. Among
other papers contributed to <i>Tait's Magazine</i>, the <i>Joan of Arc</i>
appeared in 1847. During the last ten years of his life, De Quincey
was occupied chiefly in preparing for the publishers a complete
edition of his works. Ticknor &amp; Fields, of Boston, the most
distinguished of our American publishing firms, had put forth,
1851-55, the first edition of De Quincey's collected writings, in
twenty volumes. The first British edition was undertaken by Mr. James
Hogg, of Edinburgh, in 1853, with the co-operation of the author, and
under his direction; the final volume of this edition was not issued
until the year following De Quincey's death.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1859 the frail physique of the now
<!-- Page -2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-2" id="Page_-2">Page xxii</a></span>famous
Opium-Eater grew gradually feeble, although suffering from no definite
disease. It became evident that his life was drawing to its end. On
December 8, his two daughters standing by his side, he fell into a
doze. His mind had been wandering amid the scenes of his childhood,
and his last utterance was the cry, "Sister, sister, sister!" as if in
recognition of one awaiting him, one who had been often in his dreams,
the beloved Elizabeth, whose death had made so profound and lasting an
impression on his imagination as a child.</p>

<p>The authoritative edition of <i>De Quincey's Works</i> is that edited by
David Masson and published in fourteen volumes by Adam and Charles
Black (Edinburgh). For American students the <i>Riverside Edition</i>, in
twelve volumes (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston), will be found
convenient. The most satisfactory <i>Life of De Quincey</i> is the one by
Masson in the <i>English Men of Letters</i> series. Of a more anecdotal
type are the <i>Life of De Quincey</i>, by H.A. Page, whose real name is
Alexander H. Japp (2 vols., New York, 1877), and <i>De Quincey
Memorials</i> (New York, 1891), by the same author. Very interesting is
the brief volume, <i>Recollections of Thomas De Quincey</i>, by John R.
Findlay (Edinburgh, 1886), who also contributes the paper on <i>De
Quincey</i> to the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>. <i>De Quincey and his
Friends</i>, by James Hogg (London, 1895), is another volume of
recollections, souvenirs, and anecdotes, which help to make real their
subject's personality. Besides the editor, other writers contribute to
this volume: Richard Woodhouse, John R. Findlay, and John Hill Burton,
who has given under the name "Papaverius," a picturesque description
of the Opium-Eater. The student should always remember that De
Quincey's own chapters in the <i>Autobiographic Sketches</i>, and the
<i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>, which are <!-- Page -1 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_-1" id="Page_-1">Page xxiii</a></span>among the most
charming and important of his writings, are also the most
authoritative and most valuable sources of our information concerning
him. In reading about De Quincey, do not fail to read De Quincey
himself.</p>

<p>The best criticism of the Opium-Eater's work is found in William
Minto's <i>Manual of English Prose Literature</i> (Ginn &amp; Co.). A shorter
essay is contained in Saintsbury's <i>History of Nineteenth Century
Literature</i>. A very valuable list of all De Quincey's writings, in
chronological order, is given by Fred N. Scott, in his edition of De
Quincey's essays on <i>Style, Rhetoric</i>, and <i>Language</i> (Allyn &amp; Bacon).

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_READ_DE_QUINCEY" id="HOW_TO_READ_DE_QUINCEY"></a>HOW TO READ DE QUINCEY.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"De Quincey's sixteen volumes of magazine articles are
     full of brain from beginning to end. At the rate of
     about half a volume a day, they would serve for a
     month's reading, and a month continuously might be
     worse expended. There are few courses of reading from
     which a young man of good natural intelligence would
     come away more instructed, charmed, and stimulated, or,
     to express the matter as definitely as possible, with
     his mind more <i>stretched</i>. Good natural intelligence, a
     certain fineness of fibre, and some amount of scholarly
     education, have to be presupposed, indeed, in all
     readers of De Quincey. But, even for the fittest
     readers, a month's complete and continuous course of De
     Quincey would be too much. Better have him on the
     shelf, and take down a volume at intervals for one or
     two of the articles to which there may be an immediate
     attraction. An evening with De Quincey in this manner
     will always be profitable."</p>

TERRITORIES TO THE<br /> FRONTIERS OF CHINA.</h3>
<br />

<div style="margin-left: 15%;">
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There is no great event in modern history, or, perhaps</span><br />
it may be said more broadly, none in all history, from its<br />
earliest records, less generally known, or more striking to<br />
the imagination, than the flight eastwards of a principal<br />
Tartar nation across the boundless steppes of Asia in the           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
latter half of the last century. The <i>terminus a quo</i> of this<br />
flight and the <i>terminus ad quem</i> are equally magnificent&mdash;the<br />
mightiest of Christian thrones being the<br />
one, the mightiest of pagan the other; and the grandeur of these<br />
two terminal objects is harmoniously supported by the             <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
romantic circumstances of the flight. In the abruptness<br />
of its commencement and the fierce velocity of its execution<br />
we read an expression of the wild, barbaric character<br />
of the agents. In the unity of purpose connecting this<br />
myriad of wills, and in the blind but unerring aim at a           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
mark so remote, there is something which recalls to the<br />
mind those almighty instincts that propel the migrations of<br />
the swallow and the leeming or the life-withering marches<br />
of the locust. Then, again, in the gloomy vengeance of<br />
Russia and her vast artillery, which hung upon the rear           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and the skirts of the fugitive vassals, we are reminded of<br />
Miltonic images&mdash;such, for instance, as that of the solitary<br />
hand pursuing through desert spaces and through<br />
ancient chaos a rebellious host, and overtaking with volleying<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 2</span><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>
thunders those who believed themselves already<br />
within the security of darkness and of distance.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I shall have occasion, farther on, to compare this event</span><br />
with other great national catastrophes as to the magnitude         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of the suffering. But it may also challenge a comparison<br />
with similar events under another relation,&mdash;viz. as to its<br />
dramatic capabilities. Few cases, perhaps, in romance<br />
or history, can sustain a close collation with this as to the<br />
<i>complexity</i> of its separate interests. The great outline of <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the enterprise, taken in connection with the operative<br />
motives, hidden or avowed, and the religious sanctions<br />
under which it was pursued, give to the case a triple<br />
character: 1st, That of a <i>conspiracy</i>, with as close a unity<br />
in the incidents, and as much of a personal interest in           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the moving characters, with fine dramatic contrasts, as<br />
belongs to "Venice Preserved" or to the "Fiesco" of<br />
Schiller. 2dly, That of a great military expedition offering<br />
the same romantic features of vast distances to be<br />
traversed, vast reverses to be sustained, untried routes,         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
enemies obscurely ascertained, and hardships too vaguely<br />
prefigured, which mark the Egyptian expedition of Cambyses&mdash;the<br />
anabasis of the younger Cyrus, and the<br />
subsequent retreat of the ten thousand, the Parthian<br />
expeditions of the Romans, especially those of Crassus            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
and Julian&mdash;or (as more disastrous than any of them,<br />
and, in point of space, as well as in amount of forces,<br />
more extensive) the Russian anabasis and katabasis of<br />
Napoleon. 3dly, That of a religious <i>Exodus</i>, authorized<br />
by an oracle venerated throughout many nations of Asia,           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
&mdash;an Exodus, therefore, in so far resembling the great<br />
Scriptural Exodus of the Israelites, under Moses and<br />
Joshua, as well as in the very peculiar distinction of carrying<br />
along with them their entire families, women, children,<br />
slaves, their herd of cattle and of sheep, their horses and<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 3</span><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>
their camels.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This triple character of the enterprise naturally invests</span><br />
it with a more comprehensive interest; but the dramatic<br />
interest which we ascribed to it, or its fitness for a stage       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
representation, depends partly upon the marked variety<br />
and the strength of the personal agencies concerned, and<br />
partly upon the succession of scenical situations. Even<br />
the steppes, the camels, the tents, the snowy and the sandy<br />
deserts are not beyond the scale of our modern representative     <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
powers, as often called into action in the theatres<br />
both of Paris and London; and the series of situations<br />
unfolded,&mdash;beginning with the general conflagration on<br />
the Wolga&mdash;passing thence to the disastrous scenes of<br />
the flight (as it <i>literally</i> was in its commencement)&mdash;to   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the Tartar siege of the Russian fortress Koulagina&mdash;the<br />
bloody engagement with the Cossacks in the mountain<br />
passes at Ouchim&mdash;the surprisal by the Bashkirs and<br />
the advanced posts of the Russian army at Torgau&mdash;the<br />
private conspiracy at this point against the Khan&mdash;the            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
long succession of running fights&mdash;the parting massacres<br />
at the Lake of Tengis under the eyes of the Chinese&mdash;and,<br />
finally, the tragical retribution to Zebek-Dorchi at<br />
the hunting lodge of the Chinese Emperor;&mdash;all these<br />
situations communicate a <i>scenical</i> animation to the wild    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
romance, if treated dramatically; whilst a higher and a<br />
philosophic interest belongs to it as a case of authentic<br />
history, commemorating a great revolution, for good and<br />
for evil, in the fortunes of a whole people&mdash;a people semi-barbarous,<br />
but simple-hearted, and of ancient descent.                       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the 21st of January, 1761, the young Prince Oubacha</span><br />
assumed the sceptre of the Kalmucks upon the death<br />
of his father. Some part of the power attached to this<br />
dignity he had already wielded since his fourteenth year,<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 4</span><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>
in quality of Vice-Khan, by the express appointment and<br />
with the avowed support of the Russian Government.<br />
He was now about eighteen years of age, amiable in his<br />
personal character, and not without titles to respect in his       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
public character as a sovereign prince. In times more<br />
peaceable, and amongst a people more entirely civilized<br />
or more humanized by religion, it is even probable that<br />
he might have discharged his high duties with considerable<br />
distinction; but his lot was thrown upon stormy                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
times, and a most difficult crisis amongst tribes whose<br />
native ferocity was exasperated by debasing forms of<br />
superstition, and by a nationality as well as an inflated<br />
conceit of their own merit absolutely unparalleled; whilst<br />
the circumstances of their hard and trying position under         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the jealous <i>surveillance</i> of an irresistible lord paramount,<br />
in the person of the Russian Czar, gave a fiercer edge to<br />
the natural unamiableness of the Kalmuck disposition, and<br />
irritated its gloomier qualities into action under the restless<br />
impulses of suspicion and permanent distrust. No                  <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
prince could hope for a cordial allegiance from his subjects<br />
or a peaceful reign under the circumstances of the<br />
case; for the dilemma in which a Kalmuck ruler stood<br />
at present was of this nature: <i>wanting</i> the support and<br />
sanction of the Czar, he was inevitably too weak from             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
without to command confidence from his subjects or<br />
resistance to his competitors. On the other hand, <i>with</i><br />
this kind of support, and deriving his title in any degree<br />
from the favor of the Imperial Court, he became almost<br />
in that extent an object of hatred at home and within the         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
whole compass of his own territory. He was at once an<br />
object of hatred for the past, being a living monument of<br />
national independence ignominiously surrendered; and an<br />
object of jealousy for the future, as one who had already<br />
advertised himself to be a fitting tool for the ultimate<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 5</span><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>
purposes (whatsoever those might prove to be) of the<br />
Russian Court. Coming himself to the Kalmuck sceptre<br />
under the heaviest weight of prejudice from the unfortunate<br />
circumstances of his position, it might have been                  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
expected that Oubacha would have been pre-eminently<br />
an object of detestation; for, besides his known dependence<br />
upon the Cabinet of St. Petersburg, the direct line<br />
of succession had been set aside, and the principle of<br />
inheritance violently suspended, in favor of his own              <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
father, so recently as nineteen years before the era of his<br />
own accession, consequently within the lively remembrance<br />
of the existing generation. He, therefore, almost<br />
equally with his father, stood within the full current of<br />
the national prejudices, and might have anticipated the           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
most pointed hostility. But it was not so: such are the<br />
caprices in human affairs that he was even, in a moderate<br />
sense, popular&mdash;a benefit which wore the more cheering<br />
aspect and the promises of permanence, inasmuch as he<br />
owed it exclusively to his personal qualities of kindness         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and affability, as well as to the beneficence of his government.<br />
On the other hand, to balance this unlooked-for<br />
prosperity at the outset of his reign, he met with a rival<br />
in popular favor&mdash;almost a competitor&mdash;in the person of<br />
Zebek-Dorchi, a prince with considerable pretensions to           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the throne, and, perhaps it might be said, with equal pretensions.<br />
Zebek-Dorchi was a direct descendant of the<br />
same royal house as himself, through a different branch.<br />
On public grounds, his claim stood, perhaps, on a footing<br />
equally good with that of Oubacha, whilst his personal            <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
qualities, even in those aspects which seemed to a philosophical<br />
observer most odious and repulsive, promised<br />
the most effectual aid to the dark purposes of an intriguer<br />
or a conspirator, and were generally fitted to win a popular<br />
support precisely in those points where Oubacha was<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 6</span><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>
most defective. He was much superior in external appearance<br />
to his rival on the throne, and so far better<br />
qualified to win the good opinion of a semi-barbarous<br />
people; whilst his dark intellectual qualities of Machiavelian     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
dissimulation, profound hypocrisy, and perfidy which<br />
knew no touch of remorse, were admirably calculated to<br />
sustain any ground which he might win from the simple-hearted<br />
people with whom he had to deal and from the<br />
frank carelessness of his unconscious competitor.                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
<br />
At the very outset of his treacherous career, Zebek-Dorchi<br />
was sagacious enough to perceive that nothing<br />
could be gained by open declaration of hostility to the<br />
reigning prince: the choice had been a deliberate act on<br />
the part of Russia, and Elizabeth Petrowna was not the            <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
person to recall her own favors with levity or upon slight<br />
grounds. Openly, therefore, to have declared his enmity<br />
toward his relative on the throne, could have had no effect<br />
but that of arming suspicions against his own ulterior<br />
purposes in a quarter where it was most essential to his          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
interest that, for the present, all suspicions should be<br />
hoodwinked. Accordingly, after much meditation, the<br />
course he took for opening his snares was this:&mdash;He<br />
raised a rumor that his own life was in danger from the<br />
plots of several Saissang (that is, Kalmuck nobles), who          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
were leagued together under an oath to assassinate him;<br />
and immediately after, assuming a well-counterfeited alarm,<br />
he fled to Tcherkask, followed by sixty-five tents.<br />
From this place he kept up a correspondence with the<br />
Imperial Court, and, by way of soliciting his cause more          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
effectually, he soon repaired in person to St. Petersburg.<br />
Once admitted to personal conferences with the cabinet,<br />
he found no difficulty in winning over the Russian councils<br />
to a concurrence with some of his political views,<br />
and thus covertly introducing the point of that wedge<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 7</span><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>
which was finally to accomplish his purposes. In particular,<br />
he persuaded the Russian Government to make a<br />
very important alteration in the constitution of the Kalmuck<br />
State Council which in effect reorganized the whole                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
political condition of the state and disturbed the balance<br />
of power as previously adjusted. Of this council&mdash;in<br />
the Kalmuck language called Sarga&mdash;there were eight<br />
members, called Sargatchi; and hitherto it had been the<br />
custom that these eight members should be entirely subordinate    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to the Khan; holding, in fact, the ministerial<br />
character of secretaries and assistants, but in no respect<br />
ranking as co-ordinate authorities. That had produced<br />
some inconveniences in former reigns; and it was easy<br />
for Zebek-Dorchi to point the jealousy of the Russian             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Court to others more serious which might arise in future<br />
circumstances of war or other contingencies. It was<br />
resolved, therefore, to place the Sargatchi henceforward<br />
on a footing of perfect independence, and, therefore (as<br />
regarded responsibility), on a footing of equality with the       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Khan. Their independence, however, had respect only<br />
to their own sovereign; for toward Russia they were<br />
placed in a new attitude of direct duty and accountability<br />
by the creation in their favor of small pensions (300<br />
roubles a year), which, however, to a Kalmuck of that             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
day were more considerable than might be supposed,<br />
and had a further value as marks of honorary distinction<br />
emanating from a great empress. Thus far the purposes<br />
of Zebek-Dorchi were served effectually for the moment:<br />
but, apparently, it was only for the moment; since, in            <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the further development of his plots, this very dependency<br />
upon Russian influence would be the most serious<br />
obstacle in his way. There was, however, another point<br />
carried, which outweighed all inferior considerations, as<br />
it gave him a power of setting aside discretionally whatsoever<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 8</span><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>
should arise to disturb his plots: he was himself<br />
appointed President and Controller of the Sargatchi.<br />
The Russian Court had been aware of his high pretensions           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
by birth, and hoped by this promotion to satisfy<br />
the ambition which, in some degree, was acknowledged<br />
to be a reasonable passion for any man occupying his<br />
situation.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Having thus completely blindfolded the Cabinet of</span><br />
Russia, Zebek-Dorchi proceeded in his new character to            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
fulfil his political mission with the Khan of the Kalmucks.<br />
So artfully did he prepare the road for his favorable<br />
reception at the court of this prince that he was at once<br />
and universally welcomed as a public benefactor. The<br />
pensions of the councillors were so much additional wealth        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
poured into the Tartar exchequer; as to the ties of dependency<br />
thus created, experience had not yet enlightened<br />
these simple tribes as to that result. And that he himself<br />
should be the chief of these mercenary councillors was so<br />
far from being charged upon Zebek as any offence or any           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
ground of suspicion, that his relative the Khan returned<br />
him hearty thanks for his services, under the belief that<br />
he could have accepted this appointment only with a view<br />
to keep out other and more unwelcome pretenders, who<br />
would not have had the same motives of consanguinity or           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
friendship for executing its duties in a spirit of kindness<br />
to the Kalmucks. The first use which he made of his<br />
new functions about the Khan's person was to attack the<br />
Court of Russia, by a romantic villainy not easily to be<br />
credited, for those very acts of interference with the            <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
council which he himself had prompted. This was a<br />
dangerous step: but it was indispensable to his farther<br />
advance upon the gloomy path which he had traced out<br />
for himself. A triple vengeance was what he meditated:<br />
1, upon the Russian Cabinet, for having undervalued his<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 9</span><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>
own pretensions to the throne; 2, upon his amiable rival,<br />
for having supplanted him; and 3, upon all those of the<br />
nobility who had manifested their sense of his weakness<br />
by their neglect or their sense of his perfidious character        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
by their suspicions. Here was a colossal outline of wickedness;<br />
and by one in his situation, feeble (as it might<br />
seem) for the accomplishment of its humblest parts, how<br />
was the total edifice to be reared in its comprehensive<br />
grandeur? He, a worm as he was, could he venture to               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
assail the mighty behemoth of Muscovy, the potentate<br />
who counted three hundred languages around the footsteps<br />
of his throne, and from whose "lion ramp" recoiled<br />
alike "baptized and infidel"&mdash;Christendom on the one<br />
side, strong by her intellect and her organization, and the       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
"barbaric East" on the other, with her unnumbered<br />
numbers? The match was a monstrous one; but in its<br />
very monstrosity there lay this germ of encouragement&mdash;that<br />
it could not be suspected. The very hopelessness<br />
of the scheme grounded his hope; and he resolved to               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
execute a vengeance which should involve as it were, in<br />
the unity of a well-laid tragic fable, all whom he judged<br />
to be his enemies. That vengeance lay in detaching from<br />
the Russian empire the whole Kalmuck nation and breaking<br />
up that system of intercourse which had thus far been             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
beneficial to both. This last was a consideration which<br />
moved him but little. True it was that Russia to the<br />
Kalmucks had secured lands and extensive pasturage;<br />
true it was that the Kalmucks reciprocally to Russia had<br />
furnished a powerful cavalry; but the latter loss would be        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
part of his triumph, and the former might be more than<br />
compensated in other climates, under other sovereigns.<br />
Here was a scheme which, in its final accomplishment,<br />
would avenge him bitterly on the Czarina, and in the<br />
course of its accomplishment might furnish him with<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 10</span><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>
ample occasions for removing his other enemies. It may<br />
be readily supposed, indeed, that he who could deliberately<br />
raise his eyes to the Russian autocrat as an antagonist            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
in single duel with himself was not likely to feel much<br />
anxiety about Kalmuck enemies of whatever rank. He<br />
took his resolution, therefore, sternly and irrevocably, to<br />
effect this astonishing translation of an ancient people<br />
across the pathless deserts of Central Asia, intersected<br />
continually by rapid rivers rarely furnished with bridges,        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
and of which the fords were known only to those who<br />
might think it for their interest to conceal them, through<br />
many nations inhospitable or hostile: frost and snow<br />
around them (from the necessity of commencing their<br />
flight in winter), famine in their front, and the sabre, or       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
even the artillery of an offended and mighty empress<br />
hanging upon their rear for thousands of miles. But what<br />
was to be their final mark&mdash;the port of shelter after so<br />
fearful a course of wandering? Two things were evident:<br />
it must be some power at a great distance from Russia,            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
so as to make return even in that view hopeless, and it<br />
must be a power of sufficient rank to insure them protection<br />
from any hostile efforts on the part of the Czarina<br />
for reclaiming them or for chastising their revolt. Both<br />
conditions were united obviously in the person of Kien            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Long, the reigning Emperor of China, who was further<br />
recommended to them by his respect for the head of<br />
their religion. To China, therefore, and, as their first<br />
rendezvous, to the shadow of the Great Chinese Wall, it<br />
was settled by Zebek that they should direct their flight.        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Next came the question of time&mdash;<i>when</i> should the</span><br />
flight commence? and, finally, the more delicate question<br />
as to the choice of accomplices. To extend the knowledge<br />
of the conspiracy too far was to insure its betrayal<br />
to the Russian Government. Yet, at some stage of the<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 11</span><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
preparations, it was evident that a very extensive confidence<br />
must be made, because in no other way could the<br />
mass of the Kalmuck population be persuaded to furnish<br />
their families with the requisite equipments for so long a         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
migration. This critical step, however, it was resolved<br />
to defer up to the latest possible moment, and, at all<br />
events, to make no general communication on the subject<br />
until the time of departure should be definitely<br />
settled. In the meantime, Zebek admitted only three               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
persons to his confidence; of whom Oubacha, the reigning<br />
prince, was almost necessarily one; but him, for his<br />
yielding and somewhat feeble character, he viewed rather<br />
in the light of a tool than as one of his active accomplices.<br />
Those whom (if anybody) he admitted to an unreserved              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
participation in his counsels were two only: the<br />
great Lama among the Kalmucks, and his own father-in-law,<br />
Erempel, a ruling prince of some tribe in the neighborhood<br />
of the Caspian Sea, recommended to his favor<br />
not so much by any strength of talent corresponding to            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the occasion as by his blind devotion to himself and<br />
his passionate anxiety to promote the elevation of his<br />
daughter and his son-in-law to the throne of a sovereign<br />
prince. A titular prince Zebek already was: but this<br />
dignity, without the substantial accompaniment of a sceptre,      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
seemed but an empty sound to both of these ambitious<br />
rebels. The other accomplice, whose name was<br />
Loosang-Dchaltzan, and whose rank was that of Lama,<br />
or Kalmuck pontiff, was a person of far more distinguished<br />
pretensions; he had something of the same                         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
gloomy and terrific pride which marked the character of<br />
Zebek himself, manifesting also the same energy, accompanied<br />
by the same unfaltering cruelty, and a natural<br />
facility of dissimulation even more profound. It was by<br />
this man that the other question was settled as to the<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 12</span><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
time for giving effect to their designs. His own pontifical<br />
character had suggested to him that, in order to<br />
strengthen their influence with the vast mob of simple-minded      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
men whom they were to lead into a howling<br />
wilderness, after persuading them to lay desolate their<br />
own ancient hearths, it was indispensable that they should<br />
be able, in cases of extremity, to plead the express sanction<br />
of God for their entire enterprise. This could only<br />
be done by addressing themselves to the great head of             <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
their religion, the Dalai-Lama of Tibet. Him they easily<br />
persuaded to countenance their schemes: and an oracle<br />
was delivered solemnly at Tibet, to the effect that no<br />
ultimate prosperity would attend this great Exodus unless<br />
it were pursued through the years of the <i>tiger</i> and the     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
<i>hare</i>. Now the Kalmuck custom is to distinguish their<br />
years by attaching to each a denomination taken from one<br />
of twelve animals, the exact order of succession being<br />
absolutely fixed, so that the cycle revolves of course<br />
through a period of a dozen years. Consequently, if the           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
approaching year of the <i>tiger</i> were suffered to escape<br />
them, in that case the expedition must be delayed for<br />
twelve years more; within which period, even were no<br />
other unfavorable changes to arise, it was pretty well<br />
foreseen that the Russian Government would take most              <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
effectual means for bridling their vagrant propensities by<br />
a ring-fence of forts or military posts; to say nothing of<br />
the still readier plan for securing their fidelity (a plan<br />
already talked of in all quarters) by exacting a large body<br />
of hostages selected from the families of the most influential    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
nobles. On these cogent considerations, it was solemnly<br />
determined that this terrific experiment should be<br />
made in the next year of the <i>tiger</i>, which happened to fall<br />
upon the Christian year 1771. With respect to the<br />
month, there was, unhappily for the Kalmucks, even less<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 13</span><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>
latitude allowed to their choice than with respect to the<br />
year. It was absolutely necessary, or it was thought so,<br />
that the different divisions of the nation, which pastured<br />
their flocks on both banks of the Wolga, should have the           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
means of effecting an instantaneous junction, because<br />
the danger of being intercepted by flying columns of the<br />
imperial armies was precisely the greatest at the outset.<br />
Now, from the want of bridges or sufficient river craft<br />
for transporting so vast a body of men, the sole means            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
which could be depended upon (especially where so many<br />
women, children, and camels were concerned) was <i>ice</i>;<br />
and this, in a state of sufficient firmness, could not be<br />
absolutely counted upon before the month of January.<br />
Hence it happened that this astonishing Exodus of a               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
whole nation, before so much as a whisper of the design<br />
had begun to circulate amongst those whom it most interested,<br />
before it was even suspected that any man's wishes<br />
pointed in that direction, had been definitely appointed<br />
for January of the year 1771. And almost up to the                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Christmas of 1770 the poor simple Kalmuck herdsmen<br />
and their families were going nightly to their peaceful<br />
beds without even dreaming that the <i>fiat</i> had already<br />
gone forth from their rulers which consigned those quiet<br />
abodes, together with the peace and comfort which reigned         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
within them, to a withering desolation, now close at<br />
hand.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Meantime war raged on a great scale between Russia</span><br />
and the Sultan; and, until the time arrived for throwing<br />
off their vassalage, it was necessary that Oubacha should         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
contribute his usual contingent of martial aid. Nay, it<br />
had unfortunately become prudent that he should contribute<br />
much more than his usual aid. Human experience<br />
gives ample evidence that in some mysterious and<br />
unaccountable way no great design is ever agitated, no<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 14</span><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
matter how few or how faithful may be the participators,<br />
but that some presentiment&mdash;some dim misgiving&mdash;is<br />
kindled amongst those whom it is chiefly important to<br />
blind. And, however it might have happened, certain it             <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
is that already, when as yet no syllable of the conspiracy<br />
had been breathed to any man whose very existence was<br />
not staked upon its concealment, nevertheless some vague<br />
and uneasy jealousy had arisen in the Russian Cabinet<br />
as to the future schemes of the Kalmuck Khan: and                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
very probable it is that, but for the war then raging, and<br />
the consequent prudence of conciliating a very important<br />
vassal, or, at least, of abstaining from what would powerfully<br />
alienate him, even at that moment such measures<br />
would have been adopted as must forever have intercepted          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the Kalmuck schemes. Slight as were the jealousies<br />
of the Imperial Court, they had not escaped the<br />
Machiavelian eyes of Zebek and the Lama. And under<br />
their guidance, Oubacha, bending to the circumstances of<br />
the moment, and meeting the jealousy of the Russian               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Court with a policy corresponding to their own, strove by<br />
unusual zeal to efface the Czarina's unfavorable impressions.<br />
He enlarged the scale of his contributions, and<br />
<i>that</i> so prodigiously that he absolutely carried to headquarters<br />
a force of 35,000 cavalry, fully equipped: some                   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
go further, and rate the amount beyond 40,000; but the<br />
smaller estimate is, at all events, <i>within</i> the truth.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With this magnificent array of cavalry, heavy as well as</span><br />
light, the Khan went into the field under great expectations;<br />
and these he more than realized. Having the                       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
good fortune to be concerned with so ill-organized and<br />
disorderly a description of force as that which at all times<br />
composed the bulk of a Turkish army, he carried victory<br />
along with his banners; gained many partial successes;<br />
and at last, in a pitched battle, overthrew the Turkish<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 15</span><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
force opposed to him, with a loss of 5000 men left upon<br />
the field.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">These splendid achievements seemed likely to operate</span><br />
in various ways against the impending revolt. Oubacha              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
had now a strong motive, in the martial glory acquired,<br />
for continuing his connection with the empire in whose<br />
service he had won it, and by whom only it could be fully<br />
appreciated. He was now a great marshal of a great<br />
empire, one of the Paladins around the imperial throne;           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
in China he would be nobody, or (worse than that) a mendicant<br />
alien, prostrate at the feet, and soliciting the precarious<br />
alms, of a prince with whom he had no connection.<br />
Besides, it might reasonably be expected that the Czarina,<br />
grateful for the really efficient aid given by the Tartar         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
prince, would confer upon him such eminent rewards as<br />
might be sufficient to anchor his hopes upon Russia, and<br />
to wean him from every possible seduction. These were<br />
the obvious suggestions of prudence and good sense to<br />
every man who stood neutral in the case. But they were            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
disappointed. The Czarina knew her obligations to the<br />
Khan, but she did not acknowledge them. Wherefore?<br />
That is a mystery perhaps never to be explained. So it<br />
was, however. The Khan went unhonored; no <i>ukase</i><br />
ever proclaimed his merits; and, perhaps, had he even             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
been abundantly recompensed by Russia, there were<br />
others who would have defeated these tendencies to<br />
reconciliation. Erempel, Zebek, and Loosang the Lama<br />
were pledged life-deep to prevent any accommodation;<br />
and their efforts were unfortunately seconded by those of         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
their deadliest enemies. In the Russian Court there were<br />
at that time some great nobles preoccupied with feelings<br />
of hatred and blind malice toward the Kalmucks quite as<br />
strong as any which the Kalmucks could harbor toward<br />
Russia, and not, perhaps, so well founded. Just as much<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 16</span><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
as the Kalmucks hated the Russian yoke, their galling<br />
assumption of authority, the marked air of disdain, as<br />
toward a nation of ugly, stupid, and filthy barbarians,<br />
which too generally marked the Russian bearing and                 <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
language, but, above all, the insolent contempt, or even<br />
outrages, which the Russian governors or great military<br />
commandants tolerated in their followers toward the barbarous<br />
religion and superstitious mummeries of the Kalmuck<br />
priesthood&mdash;precisely in that extent did the ferocity             <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
of the Russian resentment, and their wrath at seeing the<br />
trampled worm turn or attempt a feeble retaliation, react<br />
upon the unfortunate Kalmucks. At this crisis, it is probable<br />
that envy and wounded pride, upon witnessing the<br />
splendid victories of Oubacha and Momotbacha over the             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Turks and Bashkirs, contributed strength to the Russian<br />
irritation. And it must have been through the intrigues<br />
of those nobles about her person who chiefly smarted<br />
under these feelings that the Czarina could ever have<br />
lent herself to the unwise and ungrateful policy pursued          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
at this critical period toward the Kalmuck Khan. That<br />
Czarina was no longer Elizabeth Petrowna; it was Catharine II.&mdash;a<br />
princess who did not often err so injuriously<br />
(injuriously for herself as much as for others) in the measures<br />
of her government. She had soon ample reason for                  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
repenting of her false policy. Meantime, how much it<br />
must have co-operated with the other motives previously<br />
acting upon Oubacha in sustaining his determination to<br />
revolt, and how powerfully it must have assisted the efforts<br />
of all the Tartar chieftains in preparing the minds of their      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
people to feel the necessity of this difficult enterprise, by<br />
arming their pride and their suspicions against the Russian<br />
Government, through the keenness of their sympathy<br />
with the wrongs of their insulted prince, may be readily<br />
imagined. It is a fact, and it has been confessed by<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 17</span><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>
candid Russians themselves when treating of this great<br />
dismemberment, that the conduct of the Russian Cabinet<br />
throughout the period of suspense, and during the crisis<br />
of hesitation in the Kalmuck Council, was exactly such             <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
as was most desirable for the purposes of the conspirators;<br />
it was such, in fact, as to set the seal to all their<br />
machinations, by supplying distinct evidences and official<br />
vouchers for what could otherwise have been at the most<br />
matters of doubtful suspicion and indirect presumption.           <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nevertheless, in the face of all these arguments, and</span><br />
even allowing their weight so far as not at all to deny the<br />
injustice or the impolicy of the imperial ministers, it is<br />
contended by many persons who have reviewed the affair<br />
with a command of all the documents bearing on the case,          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
more especially the letters or minutes of council subsequently<br />
discovered in the handwriting of Zebek-Dorchi,<br />
and the important evidence of the Russian captive, Weseloff,<br />
who was carried off by the Kalmucks in their flight,<br />
that beyond all doubt Oubacha was powerless for any               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
purpose of impeding or even of delaying the revolt. He<br />
himself, indeed, was under religious obligations of the<br />
most terrific solemnity never to flinch from the enterprise<br />
or even to slacken in his zeal; for Zebek-Dorchi, distrusting<br />
the firmness of his resolution under any unusual                  <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
pressure of alarm or difficulty, had, in the very earliest<br />
stage of the conspiracy, availed himself of the Khan's<br />
well-known superstition, to engage him, by means of previous<br />
concert with the priests and their head, the Lama,<br />
in some dark and mysterious rites of consecration, terminating    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
in oaths under such terrific sanctions as no Kalmuck<br />
would have courage to violate. As far, therefore,<br />
as regarded the personal share of the Khan in what was<br />
to come, Zebek was entirely at his ease; he knew him to<br />
be so deeply pledged by religious terrors to the prosecution<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 18</span><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>
of the conspiracy that no honors within the Czarina's<br />
gift could have possibly shaken his adhesion; and then,<br />
as to threats from the same quarter, he knew him to be<br />
sealed against those fears by others of a gloomier character,      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and better adapted to his peculiar temperament. For<br />
Oubacha was a brave man, as respected all bodily enemies<br />
or the dangers of human warfare, but was as sensitive and<br />
timid as the most superstitious of old women in<br />
facing the frowns of a priest or under the vague anticipations    <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
of ghostly retributions. But had it been otherwise,<br />
and had there been any reason to apprehend an unsteady<br />
demeanor on the part of this prince at the approach<br />
of the critical moment, such were the changes already<br />
effected in the state of their domestic politics amongst          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the Tartars by the undermining arts of Zebek-Dorchi, and<br />
his ally the Lama, that very little importance would have<br />
attached to that doubt. All power was now effectually<br />
lodged in the hands of Zebek-Dorchi. He was the true<br />
and absolute wielder of the Kalmuck sceptre; all measures         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
of importance were submitted to his discretion, and<br />
nothing was finally resolved but under his dictation.<br />
This result he had brought about, in a year or two, by<br />
means sufficiently simple: first of all, by availing himself<br />
of the prejudice in his favor, so largely diffused amongst        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the lowest of the Kalmucks, that his own title to the<br />
throne in quality of great-grandson in a direct line from<br />
Ajouka, the most illustrious of all the Kalmuck Khans,<br />
stood upon a better basis than that of Oubacha, who<br />
derived from a collateral branch; secondly, with respect      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
to the sole advantage which Oubacha possessed above<br />
himself in the ratification of his title, by improving this<br />
difference between their situations to the disadvantage<br />
of his competitor, as one who had not scrupled to accept<br />
that triumph from an alien power at the price of his independence,<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 19</span><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>
which he himself (as he would have it understood)<br />
disdained to court; thirdly, by his own talents<br />
and address, coupled with the ferocious energy of his<br />
moral character; fourthly&mdash;and perhaps in an equal                 <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
degree&mdash;by the criminal facility and good nature of<br />
Oubacha; finally (which is remarkable enough, as illustrating<br />
the character of the man), by that very new modelling<br />
of the Sarga, or Privy Council, which he had used<br />
as a principal topic of abuse and malicious insinuation           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
against the Russian Government, whilst, in reality, he<br />
first had suggested the alteration to the Empress, and<br />
he chiefly appropriated the political advantages which it<br />
was fitted to yield. For, as he was himself appointed the<br />
chief of the Sargatchi, and as the pensions of the inferior       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Sargatchi passed through his hands, whilst in effect they<br />
owed their appointments to his nomination, it may be<br />
easily supposed that, whatever power existed in the state<br />
capable of controlling the Khan, being held by the Sarga<br />
under its new organization, and this body being completely        <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
under his influence, the final result was to throw<br />
all the functions of the state, whether nominally in the<br />
prince or in the council, substantially into the hands of<br />
this one man; whilst, at the same time, from the strict<br />
league which he maintained with the Lama, all the thunders        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
of the spiritual power were always ready to come in<br />
aid of the magistrate, or to supply his incapacity in cases<br />
which he could not reach.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the time was now rapidly approaching for the</span><br />
mighty experiment. The day was drawing near on which              <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the signal was to be given for raising the standard of<br />
revolt, and, by a combined movement on both sides of the<br />
Wolga, for spreading the smoke of one vast conflagration<br />
that should wrap in a common blaze their own huts and<br />
the stately cities of their enemies over the breadth and<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 20</span><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>
length of those great provinces in which their flocks were<br />
dispersed. The year of the <i>tiger</i> was now within one<br />
little month of its commencement; the fifth morning of<br />
that year was fixed for the fatal day when the fortunes            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and happiness of a whole nation were to be put upon the<br />
hazard of a dicer's throw; and as yet that nation was in<br />
profound ignorance of the whole plan. The Khan, such<br />
was the kindness of his nature, could not bring himself to<br />
make the revelation so urgently required. It was clear,           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
however, that this could not be delayed; and Zebek-Dorchi<br />
took the task willingly upon himself. But where<br />
or how should this notification be made, so as to exclude<br />
Russian hearers? After some deliberation the following<br />
plan was adopted:&mdash;Couriers, it was contrived, should             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
arrive in furious haste, one upon the heels of another,<br />
reporting a sudden inroad of the Kirghises and Bashkirs<br />
upon the Kalmuck lands, at a point distant about 120<br />
miles. Thither all the Kalmuck families, according to<br />
immemorial custom, were required to send a separate representative;             <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and there, accordingly, within three days, all<br />
appeared. The distance, the solitary ground appointed<br />
for the rendezvous, the rapidity of the march, all tended<br />
to make it almost certain that no Russian could be<br />
present. Zebek-Dorchi then came forward. He did                   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
not waste many words upon rhetoric. He unfurled an<br />
immense sheet of parchment, visible from the outermost<br />
distance at which any of this vast crowd could stand;<br />
the total number amounted to 80,000; all saw, and many heard.<br />
They were told of the oppressions of Russia;                      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
of her pride and haughty disdain, evidenced toward them<br />
by a thousand acts; of her contempt for their religion;<br />
of her determination to reduce them to absolute slavery;<br />
of the preliminary measures she had already taken by<br />
erecting forts upon many of the great rivers of their neighborhood;<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 21</span><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>
of the ulterior intentions she thus announced<br />
to circumscribe their pastoral lands, until they would all<br />
be obliged to renounce their flocks, and to collect in<br />
towns like Sarepta, there to pursue mechanical and servile         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
trades of shoemaker, tailor, and weaver, such as the free-born<br />
Tartar had always disdained. "Then again," said<br />
the subtle prince, "she increases her military levies upon<br />
our population every year. We pour out our blood as<br />
young men in her defence, or, more often, in support of           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
her insolent aggressions; and, as old men, we reap nothing<br />
from our sufferings nor benefit by our survivorship<br />
where so many are sacrificed." At this point of his<br />
harangue Zebek produced several papers (forged, as it is<br />
generally believed, by himself and the Lama), containing          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
projects of the Russian Court for a general transfer of<br />
the eldest sons, taken <i>en masse</i> from the greatest Kalmuck<br />
families, to the Imperial Court. "Now, let this be once<br />
accomplished," he argued, "and there is an end of all<br />
useful resistance from that day forwards. Petitions we            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
might make, or even remonstrances; as men of words,<br />
we might play a bold part; but for deeds; for that sort<br />
of language by which our ancestors were used to speak&mdash;holding<br />
us by such a chain, Russia would make a jest of<br />
our wishes, knowing full well that we should not dare to          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
make any effectual movement."<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Having thus sufficiently roused the angry passions of his</span><br />
vast audience, and having alarmed their fears by this<br />
pretended scheme against their firstborn (an artifice<br />
which was indispensable to his purpose, because it met            <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
beforehand <i>every</i> form of amendment to his proposal<br />
coming from the more moderate nobles, who would not<br />
otherwise have failed to insist upon trying the effect of<br />
bold addresses to the Empress before resorting to any<br />
desperate extremity), Zebek-Dorchi opened his scheme of<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 22</span><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>
revolt, and, if so, of instant revolt; since any preparations<br />
reported at St. Petersburg would be a signal for the<br />
armies of Russia to cross into such positions from all<br />
parts of Asia as would effectually intercept their march.          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
It is remarkable, however, that with all his audacity and<br />
his reliance upon the momentary excitement of the Kalmucks,<br />
the subtle prince did not venture, at this stage of<br />
his seduction, to make so startling a proposal as that of<br />
a flight to China. All that he held out for the present           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
was a rapid march to the Temba or some other great<br />
river, which they were to cross, and to take up a strong<br />
position on the farther bank, from which, as from a post<br />
of conscious security, they could hold a bolder language<br />
to the Czarina, and one which would have a better chance          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
of winning a favorable audience.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">These things, in the irritated condition of the simple</span><br />
Tartars, passed by acclamation; and all returned homeward<br />
to push forward with the most furious speed the<br />
preparations for their awful undertaking. Rapid and               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
energetic these of necessity were; and in that degree<br />
they became noticeable and manifest to the Russians who<br />
happened to be intermingled with the different hordes,<br />
either on commercial errands, or as agents officially from<br />
the Russian Government, some in a financial, others in a          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
diplomatic character.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Among these last (indeed, at the head of them) was a</span><br />
Russian of some distinction, by name Kichinskoi&mdash;a man<br />
memorable for his vanity, and memorable also as one of<br />
the many victims to the Tartar revolution. This Kichinskoi        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
had been sent by the Empress as her envoy to overlook<br />
the conduct of the Kalmucks. He was styled the<br />
Grand Pristaw, or Great Commissioner, and was universally<br />
known amongst the Tartar tribes by this title. His<br />
mixed character of ambassador and of political <i>surveillant</i>,<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 23</span><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
combined with the dependent state of the Kalmucks,<br />
gave him a real weight in the Tartar councils, and might<br />
have given him a far greater had not his outrageous<br />
self-conceit and his arrogant confidence in his own                <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
authority, as due chiefly to his personal qualities for<br />
command, led him into such harsh displays of power,<br />
and menaces so odious to the Tartar pride, as very soon<br />
made him an object of their profoundest malice. He had<br />
publicly insulted the Khan; and, upon making a communication      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
to him to the effect that some reports began to<br />
circulate, and even to reach the Empress, of a design in<br />
agitation to fly from the imperial dominions, he had ventured<br />
to say, "But this you dare not attempt; I laugh at<br />
such rumors; yes, Khan, I laugh at them to the Empress;           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
for you are a chained bear, and that you know." The<br />
Khan turned away on his heel with marked disdain; and<br />
the Pristaw, foaming at the mouth, continued to utter,<br />
amongst those of the Khan's attendants who stayed<br />
behind to catch his real sentiments in a moment of unguarded      <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
passion, all that the blindest frenzy of rage could<br />
suggest to the most presumptuous of fools. It was now<br />
ascertained that suspicion <i>had</i> arisen; but, at the same<br />
time, it was ascertained that the Pristaw spoke no more<br />
than the truth in representing himself to have discredited        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
these suspicions. The fact was that the mere infatuation<br />
of vanity made him believe that nothing could go on undetected<br />
by his all-piercing sagacity, and that no rebellion<br />
could prosper when rebuked by his commanding presence.<br />
The Tartars, therefore, pursued their preparations, confiding     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
in the obstinate blindness of the Grand Pristaw as<br />
in their perfect safeguard, and such it proved&mdash;to his<br />
own ruin as well as that of myriads beside.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Christmas arrived; and, a little before that time, courier</span><br />
upon courier came dropping in, one upon the very heels<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 24</span><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>
of another, to St. Petersburg, assuring the Czarina that<br />
beyond all doubt the Kalmucks were in the very crisis of<br />
departure. These dispatches came from the Governor<br />
of Astrachan, and copies were instantly forwarded to               <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
Kichinskoi. Now, it happened that between this governor&mdash;a<br />
Russian named Beketoff&mdash;and the Pristaw<br />
had been an ancient feud. The very name of Beketoff<br />
inflamed his resentment; and no sooner did he see that<br />
hated name attached to the dispatch than he felt himself          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
confirmed in his former views with tenfold bigotry, and<br />
wrote instantly, in terms of the most pointed ridicule,<br />
against the new alarmist, pledging his own head upon the<br />
visionariness of his alarms. Beketoff, however, was not<br />
to be put down by a few hard words, or by ridicule: he            <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
persisted in his statements; the Russian ministry were<br />
confounded by the obstinacy of the disputants; and some<br />
were beginning even to treat the Governor of Astrachan<br />
as a bore, and as the dupe of his own nervous terrors,<br />
when the memorable day arrived, the fatal 5th of January,         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
which forever terminated the dispute and put a seal upon<br />
the earthly hopes and fortunes of unnumbered myriads.<br />
The Governor of Astrachan was the first to hear the news.<br />
Stung by the mixed furies of jealousy, of triumphant<br />
vengeance, and of anxious ambition, he sprang into his            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
sledge, and, at the rate of 300 miles a day, pursued his<br />
route to St. Petersburg&mdash;rushed into the Imperial presence&mdash;announced<br />
the total realization of his worst predictions;<br />
and, upon the confirmation of this intelligence<br />
by subsequent dispatches from many different posts on             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the Wolga, he received an imperial commission to seize<br />
the person of his deluded enemy and to keep him in strict<br />
captivity. These orders were eagerly fulfilled; and the<br />
unfortunate Kichinskoi soon afterwards expired of grief<br />
and mortification in the gloomy solitude of a dungeon&mdash;a<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 25</span><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>
victim to his own immeasurable vanity and the blinding<br />
self-delusions of a presumption that refused all warning.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Governor of Astrachan had been but too faithful</span><br />
a prophet. Perhaps even <i>he</i> was surprised at the suddenness  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
with which the verification followed his reports.<br />
Precisely on the 5th of January, the day so solemnly<br />
appointed under religious sanctions by the Lama, the<br />
Kalmucks on the east bank of the Wolga were seen at<br />
the earliest dawn of day assembling by troops and                 <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
squadrons and in the tumultuous movement of some great<br />
morning of battle. Tens of thousands continued moving<br />
off the ground at every half hour's interval. Women<br />
and children, to the amount of two hundred thousand and<br />
upward, were placed upon wagons or upon camels, and               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
drew off by masses of twenty thousand at once&mdash;placed<br />
under suitable escorts, and continually swelled in numbers<br />
by other outlying bodies of the horde,&mdash;who kept falling<br />
in at various distances upon the first and second day's<br />
march. From sixty to eighty thousand of those who                 <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
were the best mounted stayed behind the rest of the<br />
tribes, with purposes of devastation and plunder more<br />
violent than prudence justified or the amiable character<br />
of the Khan could be supposed to approve. But in this,<br />
as in other instances, he was completely overruled by the         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
malignant counsels of Zebek-Dorchi. The first tempest<br />
of the desolating fury of the Tartars discharged itself<br />
upon their own habitations. But this, as cutting off all<br />
infirm looking backward from the hardships of their<br />
march, had been thought so necessary a measure by all             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the chieftains that even Oubacha himself was the first to<br />
authorize the act by his own example. He seized a torch<br />
previously prepared with materials the most durable as<br />
well as combustible, and steadily applied it to the timbers<br />
of his own palace. Nothing was saved from the general<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 26</span><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
wreck except the portable part of the domestic utensils<br />
and that part of the woodwork which could be applied<br />
to the manufacture of the long Tartar lances. This<br />
chapter in their memorable day's work being finished,              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and the whole of their villages throughout a district of<br />
ten thousand square miles in one simultaneous blaze, the<br />
Tartars waited for further orders.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">These, it was intended, should have taken a character of</span><br />
valedictory vengeance, and thus have left behind to the           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Czarina a dreadful commentary upon the main motives<br />
of their flight. It was the purpose of Zebek-Dorchi that<br />
all the Russian towns, churches, and buildings of every<br />
description should be given up to pillage and destruction,<br />
and such treatment applied to the defenceless inhabitants         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
as might naturally be expected from a fierce people<br />
already infuriated by the spectacle of their own outrages,<br />
and by the bloody retaliations which they must necessarily<br />
have provoked. This part of the tragedy, however, was<br />
happily intercepted by a providential disappointment at           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the very crisis of departure. It has been mentioned<br />
already that the motive for selecting the depth of winter<br />
as the season of flight (which otherwise was obviously<br />
the very worst possible) had been the impossibility of<br />
effecting a junction sufficiently rapid with the tribes on        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the west of the Wolga, in the absence of bridges, unless<br />
by a natural bridge of ice. For this one advantage the<br />
Kalmuck leaders had consented to aggravate by a thousand-fold<br />
the calamities inevitable to a rapid flight over<br />
boundless tracts of country with women, children, and             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
herds of cattle&mdash;for this one single advantage; and yet,<br />
after all, it was lost. The reason never has been explained<br />
satisfactorily, but the fact was such. Some have said<br />
that the signals were not properly concerted for marking<br />
the moment of absolute departure&mdash;that is, for signifying<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 27</span><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>
whether the settled intention of the Eastern Kalmucks<br />
might not have been suddenly interrupted by adverse<br />
intelligence. Others have supposed that the ice might<br />
not be equally strong on both sides of the river, and              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
might even be generally insecure for the treading of<br />
heavy and heavily laden animals such as camels. But<br />
the prevailing notion is that some accidental movements<br />
on the 3d and 4th of January of Russian troops in the<br />
neighborhood of the Western Kalmucks, though really               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
having no reference to them or their plans, had been construed<br />
into certain signs that all was discovered, and that<br />
the prudence of the Western chieftains, who, from situation,<br />
had never been exposed to those intrigues by which<br />
Zebek-Dorchi had practised upon the pride of the Eastern          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
tribes, now stepped in to save their people from ruin.<br />
Be the cause what it might, it is certain that the Western<br />
Kalmucks were in some way prevented from forming the<br />
intended junction with their brethren of the opposite<br />
bank; and the result was that at least one hundred                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
thousand of these Tartars were left behind in Russia.<br />
This accident it was which saved their Russian neighbors<br />
universally from the desolation which else awaited them.<br />
One general massacre and conflagration would assuredly<br />
have surprised them, to the utter extermination of their          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
property, their houses, and themselves, had it not been<br />
for this disappointment. But the Eastern chieftains did<br />
not dare to put to hazard the safety of their brethren<br />
under the first impulse of the Czarina's vengeance for so<br />
dreadful a tragedy; for, as they were well aware of too many      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
circumstances by which she might discover the concurrence<br />
of the Western people in the general scheme of revolt,<br />
they justly feared that she would thence infer their concurrence<br />
also in the bloody events which marked its outset.<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 28</span><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>
</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Little did the Western Kalmucks guess what reasons</span><br />
they also had for gratitude, on account of an interposition<br />
so unexpected, and which at the moment they so generally<br />
deplored. Could they but have witnessed the thousandth<br />
part of the sufferings which overtook their Eastern brethren       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
in the first month of their sad flight, they would have<br />
blessed Heaven for their own narrow escape; and yet<br />
these sufferings of the first month were but a prelude or<br />
foretaste comparatively slight of those which afterward<br />
succeeded.                                                        <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For now began to unroll the most awful series of</span><br />
calamities, and the most extensive, which is anywhere<br />
recorded to have visited the sons and daughters of men. It<br />
is possible that the sudden inroads of destroying nations,<br />
such as the Huns, or the Avars, or the Mongol                     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Tartars, may have inflicted misery as extensive; but there<br />
the misery and the desolation would be sudden, like the<br />
flight of volleying lightning. Those who were spared at<br />
first would generally be spared to the end; those who<br />
perished would perish instantly. It is possible that the          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
French retreat from Moscow may have made some nearer<br />
approach to this calamity in duration, though still a feeble<br />
and miniature approach; for the French sufferings did<br />
not commence in good earnest until about one month<br />
from the time of leaving Moscow; and though it is true            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
that afterward the vials of wrath were emptied upon the<br />
devoted army for six or seven weeks in succession, yet<br />
what is that to this Kalmuck tragedy, which lasted for<br />
more than as many months? But the main feature of<br />
horror, by which the Tartar march was distinguished from          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the French, lies in the accompaniment of women<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and<br />
children. There were both, it is true, with the French<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 29</span><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>
army, but so few as to bear no visible proportion to the<br />
total numbers concerned. The French, in short, were<br />
merely an army&mdash;a host of professional destroyers, whose<br />
regular trade was bloodshed, and whose regular element             <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
was danger and suffering. But the Tartars were a nation<br />
carrying along with them more than two hundred and<br />
fifty thousand women and children, utterly unequal, for<br />
the most part, to any contest with the calamities before<br />
them. The Children of Israel were in the same circumstances       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
as to the accompaniment of their families; but<br />
they were released from the pursuit of their enemies in a<br />
very early stage of their flight; and their subsequent residence<br />
in the Desert was not a march, but a continued halt<br />
and under a continued interposition of Heaven for their           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
comfortable support. Earthquakes, again, however comprehensive<br />
in their ravages, are shocks of a moment's<br />
duration. A much nearer approach made to the wide<br />
range and the long duration of the Kalmuck tragedy may<br />
have been in a pestilence such as that which visited              <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Athens in the Peloponnesian war, or London in the reign<br />
of Charles II. There, also, the martyrs were counted by<br />
myriads, and the period of the desolation was counted<br />
by months. But, after all, the total amount of destruction<br />
was on a smaller scale; and there was this feature of             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
alleviation to the <i>conscious</i> pressure of the calamity&mdash;that<br />
the misery was withdrawn from public notice into private<br />
chambers and hospitals. The siege of Jerusalem by<br />
Vespasian and his son, taken in its entire circumstances,<br />
comes nearest of all&mdash;for breadth and depth of suffering,         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
for duration, for the exasperation of the suffering from<br />
without by internal feuds, and, finally, for that last most<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 30</span><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>
appalling expression of the furnace heat of the anguish in<br />
its power to extinguish the natural affections even of<br />
maternal love. But, after all, each case had circumstances<br />
of romantic misery peculiar to itself&mdash;circumstances    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
without precedent, and (wherever human nature is ennobled<br />
by Christianity), it may be confidently hoped, never<br />
to be repeated.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The first point to be reached, before any hope of repose</span><br />
could be encouraged, was the River Jaik. This was not             <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
above 300 miles from the main point of departure on the<br />
Wolga; and, if the march thither was to be a forced one<br />
and a severe one, it was alleged, on the other hand, that<br />
the suffering would be the more brief and transient;<br />
one summary exertion, not to be repeated, and all was             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
achieved. Forced the march was, and severe beyond<br />
example: there the forewarning proved correct; but the<br />
promised rest proved a mere phantom of the wilderness&mdash;a<br />
visionary rainbow, which fled before their hope-sick<br />
eyes, across these interminable solitudes, for seven months       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
of hardship and calamity, without a pause. These sufferings,<br />
by their very nature and the circumstances under<br />
which they arose, were (like the scenery of the steppes)<br />
somewhat monotonous in their coloring and external<br />
features; what variety, however, there was, will be most          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
naturally exhibited by tracing historically the successive<br />
stages of the general misery exactly as it unfolded itself<br />
under the double agency of weakness still increasing from<br />
within and hostile pressure from without. Viewed in this<br />
manner, under the real order of development, it is remarkable     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
that these sufferings of the Tartars, though under<br />
the moulding hands of accident, arrange themselves<br />
almost with a scenical propriety. They seem combined<br />
as with the skill of an artist; the intensity of the misery<br />
advancing regularly with the advances of the march, and<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 31</span><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>
the stages of the calamity corresponding to the stages<br />
of the route; so that, upon raising the curtain which<br />
veils the great catastrophe, we behold one vast climax of<br />
anguish, towering upward by regular gradations as if constructed   <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
artificially for picturesque effect&mdash;a result which<br />
might not have been surprising had it been reasonable to<br />
anticipate the same rate of speed, and even an accelerated<br />
rate, as prevailing through the latter stages of the expedition.<br />
But it seemed, on the contrary, most reasonable to                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
calculate upon a continual decrement in the rate of motion<br />
according to the increasing distance from the headquarters<br />
of the pursuing enemy. This calculation, however, was<br />
defeated by the extraordinary circumstance that the Russian<br />
armies did not begin to close in very fiercely upon               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the Kalmucks until after they had accomplished a distance<br />
of full 2000 miles: 1000 miles farther on the assaults<br />
became even more tumultuous and murderous: and already<br />
the great shadows of the Chinese Wall were dimly descried,<br />
when the frenzy and <i>acharnement</i> of the pursuers and the    <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
bloody desperation of the miserable fugitives had reached<br />
its uttermost extremity. Let us briefly rehearse the main<br />
stages of the misery and trace the ascending steps of the<br />
tragedy, according to the great divisions of the route<br />
marked out by the central rivers of Asia.                         <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The first stage, we have already said, was from the</span><br />
Wolga to the Jaik; the distance about 300 miles; the time<br />
allowed seven days. For the first week, therefore, the<br />
rate of marching averaged about 43 English miles a day.<br />
The weather was cold, but bracing; and, at a more                 <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
moderate pace, this part of the journey might have been<br />
accomplished without much distress by a people as hardy<br />
as the Kalmucks: as it was, the cattle suffered greatly<br />
from overdriving; milk began to fail even for the children;<br />
the sheep perished by wholesale; and the children themselves<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 32</span><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>
were saved only by the innumerable camels.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Cossacks who dwelt upon the banks of the Jaik</span><br />
were the first among the subjects of Russia to come into<br />
collision with the Kalmucks. Great was their surprise at           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the suddenness of the irruption, and great also their consternation;<br />
for, according to their settled custom, by far<br />
the greater part of their number was absent during the<br />
winter months at the fisheries upon the Caspian. Some<br />
who were liable to surprise at the most exposed points            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
fled in crowds to the fortress of Koulagina, which was<br />
immediately invested and summoned by Oubacha. He<br />
had, however, in his train only a few light pieces of<br />
artillery; and the Russian commandant at Koulagina,<br />
being aware of the hurried circumstances in which the             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Khan was placed, and that he stood upon the very edge,<br />
as it were, of a renewed flight, felt encouraged by these<br />
considerations to a more obstinate resistance than might<br />
else have been advisable with an enemy so little disposed<br />
to observe the usages of civilized warfare. The period of         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
his anxiety was not long. On the fifth day of the siege<br />
he descried from the walls a succession of Tartar<br />
couriers, mounted upon fleet Bactrian camels, crossing<br />
the vast plains around the fortress at a furious pace and<br />
riding into the Kalmuck encampment at various points.             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Great agitation appeared immediately to follow: orders<br />
were soon after dispatched in all directions; and it became<br />
speedily known that upon a distant flank of the Kalmuck<br />
movement a bloody and exterminating battle had been<br />
fought the day before, in which one entire tribe of the           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Khan's dependents, numbering not less than 9000 fighting<br />
men, had perished to the last man. This was the<br />
<i>ouloss</i>, or clan, called Feka-Zechorr, between whom and<br />
the Cossacks there was a feud of ancient standing. In<br />
selecting, therefore, the points of attack, on occasion of<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 33</span><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>
the present hasty inroad, the Cossack chiefs were naturally<br />
eager so to direct their efforts as to combine with<br />
the service of the Empress some gratification to their own<br />
party hatreds, more especially as the present was likely           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
to be their final opportunity for revenge if the Kalmuck<br />
evasion should prosper. Having, therefore, concentrated<br />
as large a body of Cossack cavalry as circumstances<br />
allowed, they attacked the hostile <i>ouloss</i> with a precipitation<br />
which denied to it all means for communicating with               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Oubacha; for the necessity of commanding an ample range<br />
of pasturage, to meet the necessities of their vast flocks<br />
and herds, had separated this <i>ouloss</i> from the Khan's<br />
headquarters by an interval of 80 miles; and thus it was,<br />
and not from oversight, that it came to be thrown entirely        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
upon its own resources. These had proved insufficient:<br />
retreat, from the exhausted state of their horses and<br />
camels, no less than from the prodigious encumbrances<br />
of their live stock, was absolutely out of the question:<br />
quarter was disdained on the one side, and would not              <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
have been granted on the other: and thus it had happened<br />
that the setting sun of that one day (the thirteenth from<br />
the first opening of the revolt) threw his parting rays upon<br />
the final agonies of an ancient <i>ouloss</i>, stretched upon a<br />
bloody field, who on that day's dawning had held and              <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
styled themselves an independent nation.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Universal consternation was diffused through the wide</span><br />
borders of the Khan's encampment by this disastrous<br />
intelligence, not so much on account of the numbers<br />
slain, or the total extinction of a powerful ally, as because     <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the position of the Cossack force was likely to put<br />
to hazard the future advances of the Kalmucks, or at<br />
least to retard and hold them in check until the heavier<br />
columns of the Russian army should arrive upon their<br />
flanks. The siege of Koulagina was instantly raised;<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 34</span><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>
and that signal, so fatal to the happiness of the women<br />
and their children, once again resounded through the<br />
tents&mdash;the signal for flight, and this time for a flight<br />
more rapid than ever. About 150 miles ahead of their               <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
present position, there arose a tract of hilly country,<br />
forming a sort of margin to the vast, sealike expanse of<br />
champaign savannas, steppes, and occasionally of sandy<br />
deserts, which stretched away on each side of this margin<br />
both eastwards and westwards. Pretty nearly in the                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
centre of this hilly range lay a narrow defile, through<br />
which passed the nearest and the most practicable route<br />
to the River Torgau (the farther bank of which river<br />
offered the next great station of security for a general<br />
halt). It was the more essential to gain this pass before         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the Cossacks, inasmuch as not only would the delay in<br />
forcing the pass give time to the Russian pursuing<br />
columns for combining their attacks and for bringing<br />
up their artillery, but also because (even if all enemies in<br />
pursuit were thrown out of the question) it was held, by          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
those best acquainted with the difficult and obscure geography<br />
of these pathless steppes&mdash;that the loss of this one<br />
narrow strait amongst the hills would have the effect of<br />
throwing them (as their only alternative in a case where<br />
so wide a sweep of pasturage was required) upon a circuit         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
of at least 500 miles extra; besides that, after all, this<br />
circuitous route would carry them to the Torgau at a point<br />
unfitted for the passage of their heavy baggage. The<br />
defile in the hills, therefore, it was resolved to gain; and<br />
yet, unless they moved upon it with the velocity of light         <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
cavalry, there was little chance but it would be found<br />
preoccupied by the Cossacks. They, it is true, had<br />
suffered greatly in the recent sanguinary action with the<br />
defeated <i>ouloss</i>; but the excitement of victory, and the<br />
intense sympathy with their unexampled triumph, had<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 35</span><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>
again swelled their ranks, and would probably act with<br />
the force of a vortex to draw in their simple countrymen<br />
from the Caspian. The question, therefore, of preoccupation<br />
was reduced to a race. The Cossacks were marching                  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
upon an oblique line not above 50 miles longer than<br />
that which led to the same point from the Kalmuck<br />
headquarters before Koulagina; and therefore, without<br />
the most furious haste on the part of the Kalmucks, there<br />
was not a chance for them, burdened and "trashed"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> as           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
they were, to anticipate so agile a light cavalry as the<br />
Cossacks in seizing this important pass.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dreadful were the feelings of the poor women on hearing</span><br />
this exposition of the case. For they easily understood<br />
that too capital an interest (the <i>summa rerum</i>)             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
was now at stake to allow of any regard to minor interests,<br />
or what would be considered such in their present<br />
circumstances. The dreadful week already passed&mdash;their<br />
inauguration in misery&mdash;was yet fresh in their<br />
remembrance. The scars of suffering were impressed                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
not only upon their memories, but upon their very persons<br />
and the persons of their children; and they knew that,<br />
where no speed had much chance of meeting the cravings<br />
of the chieftains, no test would be accepted, short of<br />
absolute exhaustion, that as much had been accomplished           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
as could be accomplished. Weseloff, the Russian captive,<br />
has recorded the silent wretchedness with which the<br />
women and elder boys assisted in drawing the tent ropes.<br />
On the 5th of January all had been animation and the<br />
joyousness of indefinite expectation; now, on the contrary,       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
a brief but bitter experience had taught them to<br />      <span class="pagenum">Page 36</span><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>
take an amended calculation of what it was that lay<br />
before them.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">One whole day and far into the succeeding night had</span><br />
the renewed flight continued; the sufferings had been              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
greater than before, for the cold had been more intense,<br />
and many perished out of the living creatures through<br />
every class except only the camels&mdash;whose powers of<br />
endurance seemed equally adapted to cold and heat.<br />
The second morning, however, brought an alleviation to            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the distress. Snow had begun to fall; and, though not<br />
deep at present, it was easily foreseen that it soon would<br />
be so, and that, as a halt would in that case become<br />
unavoidable, no plan could be better than that of staying<br />
where they were, especially as the same cause would               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
check the advance of the Cossacks. Here, then, was the<br />
last interval of comfort which gleamed upon the unhappy<br />
nation during their whole migration. For ten days the<br />
snow continued to fall with little intermission. At the<br />
end of that time, keen, bright, frosty weather succeeded;         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the drifting had ceased. In three days the smooth expanse<br />
became firm enough to support the treading of the<br />
camels; and the flight was recommenced. But during<br />
the halt much domestic comfort had been enjoyed; and,<br />
for the last time, universal plenty. The cows and oxen            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
had perished in such vast numbers on the previous<br />
marches that an order was now issued to turn what<br />
remained to account by slaughtering the whole, and<br />
salting whatever part should be found to exceed the<br />
immediate consumption. This measure led to a scene                <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
of general banqueting, and even of festivity amongst all<br />
who were not incapacitated for joyous emotions by distress<br />
of mind, by grief for the unhappy experience of the<br />
few last days, and by anxiety for the too gloomy future.<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 37</span><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>
Seventy thousand persons of all ages had already perished,<br />
exclusively of the many thousand allies who had been cut<br />
down by the Cossack sabre. And the losses in reversion<br />
were likely to be many more. For rumors began now to<br />
arrive from all quarters, by the mounted couriers whom             <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
the Khan had dispatched to the rear and to each flank as<br />
well as in advance, that large masses of the imperial troops<br />
were converging from all parts of Central Asia to the fords<br />
of the River Torgau, as the most convenient point for<br />
intercepting the flying tribes; and it was already well           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
known that a powerful division was close in their rear,<br />
and was retarded only by the numerous artillery which<br />
had been judged necessary to support their operations.<br />
New motives were thus daily arising for quickening the<br />
motions of the wretched Kalmucks, and for exhausting              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
those who were previously but too much exhausted.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It was not until the 2d day of February that the</span><br />
Khan's advanced guard came in sight of Ouchim, the<br />
defile among the hills of Moulgaldchares, in which they<br />
anticipated so bloody an opposition from the Cossacks.            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
A pretty large body of these light cavalry had, in fact,<br />
preoccupied the pass by some hours; but the Khan,<br />
having two great advantages&mdash;namely, a strong body of<br />
infantry, who had been conveyed by sections of five on<br />
about two hundred camels, and some pieces of light    <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
artillery which he had not yet been forced to abandon&mdash;soon<br />
began to make a serious impression upon this<br />
unsupported detachment; and they would probably at any<br />
rate have retired; but, at the very moment when they<br />
were making some dispositions in that view, Zebek-Dorchi          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
appeared upon their rear with a body of trained riflemen,<br />
who had distinguished themselves in the war with Turkey.<br />
These men had contrived to crawl unobserved over the<br />
cliffs which skirted the ravine, availing themselves of the<br />
dry beds of the summer torrents and other inequalities of<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 38</span><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>
the ground to conceal their movement. Disorder and<br />
trepidation ensued instantly in the Cossack files; the<br />
Khan, who had been waiting with the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of his heavy<br />
cavalry, charged furiously upon them. Total overthrow              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
followed to the Cossacks, and a slaughter such as in some<br />
measure avenged the recent bloody extermination of their<br />
allies, the ancient <i>ouloss</i> of Feka-Zechorr. The slight<br />
horses of the Cossacks were unable to support the weight<br />
of heavy Polish dragoons and a body of trained <i>cameleers</i>   <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
(that is, cuirassiers mounted on camels); hardy they were,<br />
but not strong, nor a match for their antagonists in weight;<br />
and their extraordinary efforts through the last few days<br />
to gain their present position had greatly diminished their<br />
powers for effecting an escape. Very few, in fact, <i>did</i>     <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
escape; and the bloody day of Ouchim became as memorable<br />
among the Cossacks as that which, about twenty<br />
days before, had signalized the complete annihilation of<br />
the Feka-Zechorr.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The road was now open to the River Igritch, and as yet</span>            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
even far beyond it to the Torgau; but how long this<br />
state of things would continue was every day more<br />
doubtful. Certain intelligence was now received that a<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 39</span><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>
large Russian army, well appointed in every arm, was<br />
advancing upon the Torgau under the command of<br />
General Traubenberg. This officer was to be joined on<br />
his route by ten thousand Bashkirs, and pretty nearly the          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
same amount of Kirghises&mdash;both hereditary enemies of<br />
the Kalmucks&mdash;both exasperated to a point of madness<br />
by the bloody trophies which Oubacha and Momotbacha<br />
had, in late years, won from such of their compatriots as<br />
served under the Sultan. The Czarina's yoke these wild            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
nations bore with submissive patience, but not the hands<br />
by which it had been imposed; and accordingly, catching<br />
with eagerness at the present occasion offered to their<br />
vengeance, they sent an assurance to the Czarina of their<br />
perfect obedience to her commands, and at the same time           <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
a message significantly declaring in what spirit they meant<br />
to execute them&mdash;viz. "that they would not trouble her<br />
Majesty with prisoners."<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Here then arose, as before with the Cossacks, a race</span><br />
for the Kalmucks with the regular armies of Russia, and           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
concurrently with nations as fierce and semi-humanized<br />
as themselves, besides that they were stung into threefold<br />
activity by the furies of mortified pride and military<br />
abasement, under the eyes of the Turkish Sultan. The<br />
forces, and more especially the artillery, of Russia were         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
far too overwhelming to permit the thought of a regular<br />
opposition in pitched battles, even with a less dilapidated<br />
state of their resources than they could reasonably expect<br />
at the period of their arrival on the Torgau. In their<br />
speed lay their only hope&mdash;in strength of foot, as before,        <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
and not in strength of arm. Onward, therefore, the Kalmucks<br />
pressed, marking the lines of their wide-extending<br />
march over the sad solitudes of the steppes by a never-ending<br />
chain of corpses. The old and the young, the<br />
sick man on his couch, the mother with her baby&mdash;all<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 40</span><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>
were left behind. Sights such as these, with the many<br />
rueful aggravations incident to the helpless condition of<br />
infancy&mdash;of disease and of female weakness abandoned<br />
to the wolves amidst a howling wilderness&mdash;continued to            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
track their course through a space of full two thousand<br />
miles; for so much at the least it was likely to prove,<br />
including the circuits to which they were often compelled<br />
by rivers or hostile tribes, from the point of starting on<br />
the Wolga until they could reach their destined halting           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
ground on the east bank of the Torgau. For the first<br />
seven weeks of this march their sufferings had been imbittered<br />
by the excessive severity of the cold; and every<br />
night&mdash;so long as wood was to be had for fires, either<br />
from the lading of the camels, or from the desperate sacrifice    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
of their baggage wagons, or (as occasionally happened)<br />
from the forests which skirted the banks of the many<br />
rivers which crossed their path&mdash;no spectacle was more<br />
frequent than that of a circle, composed of men, women,<br />
and children, gathered by hundreds round a central fire,          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
all dead and stiff at the return of morning light. Myriads<br />
were left behind from pure exhaustion, of whom none<br />
had a chance, under the combined evils which beset<br />
them, of surviving through the next twenty-four hours.<br />
Frost, however, and snow at length ceased to persecute;           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the vast extent of the march at length brought them into<br />
more genial latitudes, and the unusual duration of the<br />
march was gradually bringing them into more genial<br />
seasons of the year. Two thousand miles had at least<br />
been traversed; February, March, April, were gone; the            <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
balmy month of May had opened; vernal sights and<br />
sounds came from every side to comfort the heart-weary<br />
travellers; and at last, in the latter end of May, crossing<br />
the Torgau, they took up a position where they hoped to<br />
find liberty to repose themselves for many weeks in comfort<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 41</span><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>
as well as in security, and to draw such supplies from<br />
the fertile neighborhood as might restore their shattered<br />
forces to a condition for executing, with less of wreck<br />
and ruin, the large remainder of the journey.                      <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yes; it was true that two thousand miles of wandering</span><br />
had been completed, but in a period of nearly five<br />
months, and with the terrific sacrifice of at least two hundred<br />
and fifty thousand souls, to say nothing of herds and<br />
flocks past all reckoning. These had all perished: ox,            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
cow, horse, mule, ass, sheep, or goat, not one survived&mdash;only<br />
the camels. These arid and adust creatures, looking<br />
like the mummies of some antediluvian animals, without<br />
the affections or sensibilities of flesh and blood&mdash;these<br />
only still erected their speaking eyes to the eastern             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
heavens, and had to all appearance come out from this<br />
long tempest of trial unscathed and hardly diminished.<br />
The Khan, knowing how much he was individually<br />
answerable for the misery which had been sustained,<br />
must have wept tears even more bitter than those of               <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Xerxes when he threw his eyes over the myriads whom<br />
he had assembled: for the tears of Xerxes were<br />
unmingled with compunction. Whatever amends were in<br />
his power, the Khan resolved to make, by sacrifices to<br />
the general good of all personal regards; and, accordingly,       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
even at this point of their advance, he once more deliberately<br />
brought under review the whole question of the<br />
revolt. The question was formally debated before the<br />
Council, whether, even at this point, they should untread<br />
their steps, and, throwing themselves upon the Czarina's          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
mercy, return to their old allegiance. In that case,<br />
Oubacha professed himself willing to become the scapegoat<br />
for the general transgression. This, he argued, was<br />
no fantastic scheme, but even easy of accomplishment;<br />
for the unlimited and sacred power of the Khan, so well<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 42</span><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>
known to the Empress, made it absolutely iniquitous to<br />
attribute any separate responsibility to the people. Upon<br />
the Khan rested the guilt&mdash;upon the Khan would<br />
descend the imperial vengeance. This proposal was                  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
applauded for its generosity, but was energetically opposed<br />
by Zebek-Dorchi. Were they to lose the whole<br />
journey of two thousand miles? Was their misery to<br />
perish without fruit? True it was that they had yet<br />
reached only the halfway house; but, in that respect,             <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
the motives were evenly balanced for retreat or for<br />
advance. Either way they would have pretty nearly<br />
the same distance to traverse, but with this difference&mdash;that,<br />
forwards, their route lay through lands comparatively<br />
fertile; backwards, through a blasted wilderness,                 <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
rich only in memorials of their sorrow, and hideous to<br />
Kalmuck eyes by the trophies of their calamity. Besides,<br />
though the Empress might accept an excuse for the past,<br />
would she the less forbear to suspect for the future?<br />
The Czarina's <i>pardon</i> they might obtain, but could they     <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
ever hope to recover her <i>confidence</i>? Doubtless there<br />
would now be a standing presumption against them, an<br />
immortal ground of jealousy; and a jealous government<br />
would be but another name for a harsh one. Finally,<br />
whatever motives there ever had been for the revolt               <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
surely remained unimpaired by anything that had occurred.<br />
In reality the revolt was, after all, no revolt,<br />
but (strictly speaking) a return to their old allegiance;<br />
since, not above one hundred and fifty years ago (viz. in<br />
the year 1616), their ancestors had revolted from the             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Emperor of China. They had now tried both governments;<br />
and for them China was the land of promise, and<br />
Russia the house of bondage.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Spite, however, of all that Zebek could say or do, the</span><br />
yearning of the people was strongly in behalf of the<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 43</span><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>
Khan's proposal; the pardon of their prince, they persuaded<br />
themselves, would be readily conceded by the<br />
Empress: and there is little doubt that they would at<br />
this time have thrown themselves gladly upon the imperial          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
mercy; when suddenly all was defeated by the arrival of<br />
two envoys from Traubenberg. This general had reached<br />
the fortress of Orsk, after a very painful march, on the<br />
12th of April; thence he set forward toward Oriembourg,<br />
which he reached upon the 1st of June, having been                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
joined on his route at various times through the month<br />
of May by the Kirghises and a corps of ten thousand<br />
Bashkirs. From Oriembourg he sent forward his official<br />
offers to the Khan, which were harsh and peremptory,<br />
holding out no specific stipulations as to pardon or              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
impunity, an exacting unconditional submission as the<br />
preliminary price of any cessation from military operations.<br />
The personal character of Traubenberg, which<br />
was anything but energetic, and the condition of his<br />
army, disorganized in a great measure by the length and           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
severity of the march, made it probable that, with a little<br />
time for negotiation, a more conciliatory tone would have<br />
been assumed. But, unhappily for all parties, sinister<br />
events occurred in the meantime such as effectually put<br />
an end to every hope of the kind.                                 <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The two envoys sent forward by Traubenberg had</span><br />
reported to this officer that a distance of only ten days'<br />
march lay between his own headquarters and those of<br />
the Khan. Upon this fact transpiring, the Kirghises, by<br />
their prince Nourali, and the Bashkirs, entreated the             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Russian general to advance without delay. Once having<br />
placed his cannon in position, so as to command the<br />
Kalmuck camp, the fate of the rebel Khan and his<br />
people would be in his own hands, and they would<br />
themselves form his advanced guard. Traubenberg, however<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 44</span><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>
(<i>why</i> has not been certainly explained), refused to<br />
march; grounding his refusal upon the condition of his<br />
army and their absolute need of refreshment. Long<br />
and fierce was the altercation; but at length, seeing no           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
chance of prevailing, and dreading above all other events<br />
the escape of their detested enemy, the ferocious Bashkirs<br />
went off in a body by forced marches. In six days<br />
they reached the Torgau, crossed by swimming their<br />
horses, and fell upon the Kalmucks, who were dispersed            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
for many a league in search of food or provender for<br />
their camels. The first day's action was one vast succession<br />
of independent skirmishes, diffused over a field<br />
of thirty to forty miles in extent; one party often breaking<br />
up into three or four, and again (according to the                <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
accidents of ground) three or four blending into one;<br />
flight and pursuit, rescue and total overthrow, going on<br />
simultaneously, under all varieties of form, in all<br />
quarters of the plain. The Bashkirs had found themselves obliged,<br />
by the scattered state of the Kalmucks, to split up into          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
innumerable sections; and thus, for some hours, it had<br />
been impossible for the most practised eye to collect the<br />
general tendency of the day's fortune. Both the Khan<br />
and Zebek-Dorchi were at one moment made prisoners,<br />
and more than once in imminent danger of being cut                <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
down; but at length Zebek succeeded in rallying a<br />
strong column of infantry, which, with the support of the<br />
camel corps on each flank, compelled the Bashkirs to<br />
retreat. Clouds, however, of these wild cavalry continued<br />
to arrive through the next two days and nights, followed          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
or accompanied by the Kirghises. These being viewed<br />
as the advanced parties of Traubenberg's army, the<br />
Kalmuck chieftains saw no hope of safety but in flight;<br />
and in this way it happened that a retreat, which had so<br />
recently been brought to a pause, was resumed at the<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 45</span><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>
very moment when the unhappy fugitives were anticipating<br />
a deep repose, without further molestation, the whole<br />
summer through.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It seemed as though every variety of wretchedness</span>                  <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
were predestined to the Kalmucks, and as if their sufferings<br />
were incomplete unless they were rounded and<br />
matured by all that the most dreadful agencies of summer's<br />
heat could superadd to those of frost and winter.<br />
To this sequel of their story we shall immediately revert,        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
after first noticing a little romantic episode which occurred<br />
at this point between Oubacha and his unprincipled<br />
cousin, Zebek-Dorchi.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There was, at the time of the Kalmuck flight from the</span><br />
Wolga, a Russian gentleman of some rank at the court              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
of the Khan, whom, for political reasons, it was thought<br />
necessary to carry along with them as a captive. For<br />
some weeks his confinement had been very strict, and in<br />
one or two instances cruel; but, as the increasing distance<br />
was continually diminishing the chances of escape,                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and perhaps, also, as the misery of the guards gradually<br />
withdrew their attention from all minor interests to their<br />
own personal sufferings, the vigilance of the custody<br />
grew more and more relaxed; until at length, upon a<br />
petition to the Khan, Mr. Weseloff was formally restored          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
to liberty; and it was understood that he might use his<br />
liberty in whatever way he chose; even for returning<br />
to Russia, if that should be his wish. Accordingly, he<br />
was making active preparations for his journey to St.<br />
Petersburg, when it occurred to Zebek-Dorchi that not             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
improbably, in some of the battles which were then anticipated<br />
with Traubenberg, it might happen to them to<br />
lose some prisoner of rank,&mdash;in which case the Russian<br />
Weseloff would be a pledge in their hands for negotiating<br />
an exchange. Upon this plea, to his own severe affliction,<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 46</span><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>
the Russian was detained until the further pleasure<br />
of the Khan. The Khan's name, indeed, was used<br />
through the whole affair, but, as it seemed, with so little<br />
concurrence on his part, that, when Weseloff in a private          <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
audience humbly remonstrated upon the injustice done<br />
him and the cruelty of thus sporting with his feelings by<br />
setting him at liberty, and, as it were, tempting him into<br />
dreams of home and restored happiness only for the purpose<br />
of blighting them, the good-natured prince disclaimed             <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
all participation in the affair, and went so far in<br />
proving his sincerity as even to give him permission to<br />
effect his escape; and, as a ready means of commencing<br />
it without raising suspicion, the Khan mentioned to Mr.<br />
Weseloff that he had just then received a message from             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the Hetman of the Bashkirs, soliciting a private interview<br />
on the banks of the Torgau at a spot pointed out. That<br />
interview was arranged for the coming night; and Mr.<br />
Weseloff might go in the Khan's <i>suite</i>, which on either<br />
side was not to exceed three persons. Weseloff was a              <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
prudent man, acquainted with the world, and he read<br />
treachery in the very outline of this scheme, as stated by<br />
the Khan&mdash;treachery against the Khan's person. He<br />
mused a little, and then communicated so much of his<br />
suspicions to the Khan as might put him on his guard;             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
but, upon further consideration, he begged leave to<br />
decline the honor of accompanying the Khan. The fact<br />
was that three Kalmucks, who had strong motives for<br />
returning to their countrymen on the west bank of the<br />
Wolga, guessing the intentions of Weseloff, had offered           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
to join him in his escape. These men the Khan would<br />
probably find himself obliged to countenance in their<br />
project, so that it became a point of honor with Weseloff<br />
to conceal their intentions, and therefore to accomplish<br />
the evasion from the camp (of which the first steps only<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 47</span><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>
would be hazardous) without risking the notice of the<br />
Khan.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The district in which they were now encamped</span><br />
abounded through many hundred miles with wild horses               <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
of a docile and beautiful breed. Each of the four fugitives<br />
had caught from seven to ten of these spirited<br />
creatures in the course of the last few days. This<br />
raised no suspicion, for the rest of the Kalmucks had<br />
been making the same sort of provision against the coming         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
toils of their remaining route to China. These horses<br />
were secured by halters, and hidden about dusk in the<br />
thickets which lined the margin of the river. To these<br />
thickets, about ten at night, the four fugitives repaired.<br />
They took a circuitous path, which drew them as little as         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
possible within danger of challenge from any of the outposts<br />
or of the patrols which had been established on the<br />
quarters where the Bashkirs lay; and in three-quarters of<br />
an hour they reached the rendezvous. The moon had<br />
now risen, the horses were unfastened; and they were              <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
in the act of mounting, when the deep silence of the<br />
woods was disturbed by a violent uproar and the clashing<br />
of arms. Weseloff fancied that he heard the voice of<br />
the Khan shouting for assistance. He remembered<br />
the communication made by that prince in the morning; and,        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
requesting his companions to support him, he rode off in<br />
the direction of the sound. A very short distance brought<br />
him to an open glade in the wood, where he beheld four<br />
men contending with a party of at least nine or ten.<br />
Two of the four were dismounted at the very instant of            <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
Weseloff's arrival. One of these he recognized almost<br />
certainly as the Khan, who was fighting hand to hand,<br />
but at great disadvantage, with two of the adverse horsemen.<br />
Seeing that no time was to be lost, Weseloff fired<br />
and brought down one of the two. His companions discharged<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 48</span><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>
their carabines at the same moment; and then all<br />
rushed simultaneously into the little open area. The<br />
thundering sound of about thirty horses, all rushing at<br />
once into a narrow space, gave the impression that a               <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
whole troop of cavalry was coming down upon the assailants,<br />
who accordingly wheeled about and fled with one<br />
impulse. Weseloff advanced to the dismounted cavalier,<br />
who, as he expected, proved to be the Khan. The man<br />
whom Weseloff had shot was lying dead; and both were              <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
shocked, though Weseloff at least was not surprised, on<br />
stooping down and scrutinizing his features, to recognize<br />
a well-known confidential servant of Zebek-Dorchi.<br />
Nothing was said by either party. The Khan rode off,<br />
escorted by Weseloff and his companions; and for some             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
time a dead silence prevailed. The situation of Weseloff<br />
was delicate and critical. To leave the Khan at this point<br />
was probably to cancel their recent services; for he might<br />
be again crossed on his path, and again attacked, by the<br />
very party from whom he had just been delivered. Yet, on          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the other hand, to return to the camp was to endanger the<br />
chances of accomplishing the escape. The Khan, also, was<br />
apparently revolving all this in his mind; for at length he<br />
broke silence and said: "I comprehend your situation;<br />
and, under other circumstances, I might feel it my duty to        <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
detain your companions, but it would ill become me to do<br />
so after the important service you have just rendered me.<br />
Let us turn a little to the left. There, where you see the<br />
watch fire, is an outpost. Attend me so far. I am then<br />
safe. You may turn and pursue your enterprise; for                <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the circumstances under which you will appear as my<br />
escort are sufficient to shield you from all suspicion for<br />
the present. I regret having no better means at my disposal<br />
for testifying my gratitude. But tell me before we<br />
part&mdash;was it accident only which led you to my rescue?<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 49</span><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
Or had you acquired any knowledge of the plot by which<br />
I was decoyed into this snare?" Weseloff answered very<br />
candidly that mere accident had brought him to the spot<br />
at which he heard the uproar; but that, <i>having</i> heard it,    <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and connecting it with the Khan's communication of the<br />
morning, he had then designedly gone after the sound in<br />
a way which he certainly should not have done, at so<br />
critical a moment, unless in the expectation of finding<br />
the Khan assaulted by assassins. A few minutes after              <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
they reached the outpost at which it became safe to<br />
leave the Tartar chieftain; and immediately the four<br />
fugitives commenced a flight which is, perhaps, without a<br />
parallel in the annals of travelling. Each of them led<br />
six or seven horses besides the one he rode; and by               <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
shifting from one to the other (like the ancient Desultors<br />
of the Roman circus), so as never to burden the same<br />
horse for more than half an hour at a time, they continued<br />
to advance at the rate of 200 miles in the twenty-four<br />
hours for three days consecutively. After that time,              <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
considering themselves beyond pursuit, they proceeded<br />
less rapidly; though still with a velocity which staggered<br />
the belief of Weseloff's friends in after years. He was,<br />
however, a man of high principle, and always adhered<br />
firmly to the details of his printed report. One of the           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
circumstances there stated is that they continued to pursue<br />
the route by which the Kalmucks had fled, never for<br />
an instant finding any difficulty in tracing it by the skeletons<br />
and other memorials of their calamities. In particular,<br />
he mentions vast heaps of money as part of the                    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
valuable property which it had been necessary to sacrifice.<br />
These heaps were found lying still untouched in<br />
the deserts. From these Weseloff and his companions<br />
took as much as they could conveniently carry; and this<br />
it was, with the price of their beautiful horses, which they<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 50</span><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
afterward sold at one of the Russian military settlements<br />
for about &pound;15 apiece, which eventually enabled them to<br />
pursue their journey in Russia. This journey, as regarded<br />
Weseloff in particular, was closed by a tragical catastrophe.      <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
He was at that time young and the only child<br />
of a doting mother. Her affliction under the violent abduction<br />
of her son had been excessive, and probably had<br />
undermined her constitution. Still she had supported it.<br />
Weseloff, giving way to the natural impulses of his filial        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
affection, had imprudently posted through Russia to his<br />
mother's house without warning of his approach. He<br />
rushed precipitately into her presence; and she, who had<br />
stood the shocks of sorrow, was found unequal to the<br />
shock of joy too sudden and too acute. She died upon              <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
the spot.<br /></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We now revert to the final scenes of the Kalmuck</span><br />
flight. These it would be useless to pursue circumstantially<br />
through the whole two thousand miles of suffering<br />
which remained; for the character of that suffering was           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
even more monotonous than on the former half of the<br />
flight, but also more severe. Its main elements were<br />
excessive heat, with the accompaniments of famine and<br />
thirst, but aggravated at every step by the murderous<br />
attacks of their cruel enemies, the Bashkirs and the              <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Kirghises.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">These people, "more fell than anguish, hunger, or</span><br />
the sea," stuck to the unhappy Kalmucks like a swarm of<br />
enraged hornets. And very often, while <i>they</i> were<br />
attacking them in the rear, their advanced parties and          <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
flanks were attacked with almost equal fury by the people<br />
of the country which they were traversing; and with good<br />
reason, since the law of self-preservation had now obliged<br />
the fugitive Tartars to plunder provisions and to forage<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 51</span><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>
wherever they passed. In this respect their condition<br />
was a constant oscillation of wretchedness; for sometimes,<br />
pressed by grinding famine, they took a circuit of<br />
perhaps a hundred miles, in order to strike into a land            <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
rich in the comforts of life; but in such a land they were<br />
sure to find a crowded population, of which every arm<br />
was raised in unrelenting hostility, with all the advantages<br />
of local knowledge, and with constant preoccupation of<br />
all the defensible positions, mountain passes, or bridges.        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Sometimes, again, wearied out with this mode of suffering,<br />
they took a circuit of perhaps a hundred miles, in<br />
order to strike into a land with few or no inhabitants.<br />
But in such a land they were sure to meet absolute<br />
starvation. Then, again, whether with or without this             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
plague of starvation, whether with or without this plague<br />
of hostility in front, whatever might be the "fierce varieties"<br />
of their misery in this respect, no rest ever came<br />
to their unhappy rear; <i>post equitem sedet atra cura</i>: it<br />
was a torment like the undying worm of conscience.                <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
And, upon the whole, it presented a spectacle altogether<br />
unprecedented in the history of mankind. Private and<br />
personal malignity is not unfrequently immortal; but rare<br />
indeed is it to find the same pertinacity of malice in<br />
a nation. And what imbittered the interest was that the           <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
malice was reciprocal. Thus far the parties met upon<br />
equal terms; but that equality only sharpened the sense<br />
of their dire inequality as to other circumstances. The<br />
Bashkirs were ready to fight "from morn till dewy eve."<br />
The Kalmucks, on the contrary, were always obliged to             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
run. Was it <i>from</i> their enemies as creatures whom they<br />
feared? No; but <i>towards</i> their friends&mdash;towards that<br />
final haven of China&mdash;as what was hourly implored by<br />
the prayers of their wives and the tears of their children.<br />
But, though they fled unwillingly, too often they fled in<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 52</span><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>
vain&mdash;being unwillingly recalled. There lay the torment.<br />
Every day the Bashkirs fell upon them; every<br />
day the same unprofitable battle was renewed; as a<br />
matter of course, the Kalmucks recalled part of their              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
advanced guard to fight them; every day the battle raged<br />
for hours, and uniformly with the same result. For, no<br />
sooner did the Bashkirs find themselves too heavily<br />
pressed, and that the Kalmuck march had been retarded<br />
by some hours, than they retired into the boundless               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
deserts, where all pursuit was hopeless. But if the Kalmucks<br />
resolved to press forwards, regardless of their enemies&mdash;in<br />
that case their attacks became so fierce and<br />
overwhelming that the general safety seemed likely to be<br />
brought into question; nor could any effectual remedy             <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
be applied to the case, even for each separate day, except<br />
by a most embarrassing halt and by countermarches<br />
that, to men in their circumstances, were almost worse<br />
than death. It will not be surprising that the irritation<br />
of such a systematic persecution, superadded to a previous,       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
and hereditary hatred, and accompanied by the<br />
stinging consciousness of utter impotence as regarded all<br />
effectual vengeance, should gradually have inflamed the<br />
Kalmuck animosity into the wildest expression of downright<br />
madness and frenzy. Indeed, long before the                       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
frontiers of China were approached, the hostility of both<br />
sides had assumed the appearance much more of a<br />
warfare amongst wild beasts than amongst creatures<br />
acknowledging the restraints of reason or the claims of a<br />
common nature. The spectacle became too atrocious; it             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
was that of a host of lunatics pursued by a host of fiends.<br /></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On a fine morning in early autumn of the year 1771,</span><br />
Kien Long, the Emperor of China, was pursuing his<br />
amusements in a wild frontier district lying on the outside<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 53</span><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>
of the Great Wall. For many hundred square<br />
leagues the country was desolate of inhabitants, but rich<br />
in woods of ancient growth, and overrun with game of<br />
every description. In a central spot of this solitary              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
region the Emperor had built a gorgeous hunting lodge,<br />
to which he resorted annually for recreation and relief<br />
from the cares of government. Led onwards in pursuit of<br />
game, he had rambled to a distance of 200 miles or<br />
more from his lodge, followed at a little distance by a           <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
sufficient military escort, and every night pitching his<br />
tent in a different situation, until at length he had arrived<br />
on the very margin of the vast central deserts of Asia.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><br />
Here he was standing by accident, at an opening of his<br />
pavilion, enjoying the morning sunshine, when suddenly            <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
to the westward there arose a vast, cloudy vapor, which<br />
by degrees expanded, mounted, and seemed to be slowly<br />
diffusing itself over the whole face of the heavens. By<br />
and by this vast sheet of mist began to thicken toward<br />
the horizon and to roll forward in billowy volumes. The           <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Emperor's suite assembled from all quarters; the silver<br />
trumpets were sounded in the rear; and from all the<br />
glades and forest avenues began to trot forwards towards<br />
the pavilion the yagers&mdash;half cavalry, half huntsmen&mdash;who<br />
composed the imperial escort. Conjecture was on                   <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the stretch to divine the cause of this phenomenon; and<br />
the interest continually increased in proportion as simple<br />
curiosity gradually deepened into the anxiety of uncertain<br />
danger. At first it had been imagined that some vast<br />
troops of deer or other wild animals of the chase had<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 54</span><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>
been disturbed in their forest haunts by the Emperor's<br />
movements, or possibly by wild beasts prowling for prey,<br />
and might be fetching a compass by way of re-entering<br />
the forest grounds at some remoter points, secure from             <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
molestation. But this conjecture was dissipated by the<br />
slow increase of the cloud and the steadiness of its<br />
motion. In the course of two hours the vast phenomenon<br />
had advanced to a point which was judged to be<br />
within five miles of the spectators, though all calculations      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
of distance were difficult, and often fallacious, when<br />
applied to the endless expanses of the Tartar deserts.<br />
Through the next hour, during which the gentle morning<br />
breeze had a little freshened, the dusty vapor had developed<br />
itself far and wide into the appearance of huge                   <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
a&euml;rial draperies, hanging in mighty volumes from the sky<br />
to the earth; and at particular points, where the eddies<br />
of the breeze acted upon the pendulous skirts of these<br />
a&euml;rial curtains, rents were perceived, sometimes taking the<br />
form of regular arches, portals, and windows, through             <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
which began dimly to gleam the heads of camels "indorsed"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br />
with human beings, and at intervals the moving<br />
of men and horses in tumultuous array, and then through<br />
other openings, or vistas, at far-distant points, the flashing<br />
of polished arms. But sometimes, as the wind slackened            <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
or died away, all those openings, of whatever form,<br />
in the cloudy pall, would slowly close, and for a time the<br />
whole pageant was shut up from view; although the<br />
growing din, the clamors, the shrieks, and groans ascending<br />
from infuriated myriads, reported, in a language not              <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
to be misunderstood, what was going on behind the<br />
cloudy screen.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It was, in fact, the Kalmuck host, now in the last</span> <span class="pagenum">Page 55</span><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>
extremities of their exhaustion, and very fast approaching<br />
to that final stage of privation and killing misery beyond<br />
which few or none could have lived, but also, happily for<br />
themselves, fast approaching (in a literal sense) that final       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
stage of their long pilgrimage at which they would meet<br />
hospitality on a scale of royal magnificence and full protection<br />
from their enemies. These enemies, however, as<br />
yet, still were hanging on their rear as fiercely as ever,<br />
though this day was destined to be the last of their hideous      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
persecution. The Khan had, in fact, sent forward<br />
couriers with all the requisite statements and petitions,<br />
addressed to the Emperor of China. These had been<br />
duly received, and preparations made in consequence to<br />
welcome the Kalmucks with the most paternal benevolence.          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
But as these couriers had been dispatched from<br />
the Torgau at the moment of arrival thither, and before<br />
the advance of Traubenberg had made it necessary<br />
for the Khan to order a hasty renewal of the flight, the<br />
Emperor had not looked for their arrival on his frontiers         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
until full three months after the present time. The Khan<br />
had, indeed, expressly notified his intention to pass the<br />
summer heats on the banks of the Torgau, and to recommence<br />
his retreat about the beginning of September. The<br />
subsequent change of plan being unknown to Kien Long,             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
left him for some time in doubt as to the true interpretation<br />
to be put upon this mighty apparition in the desert:<br />
but at length the savage clamors of hostile fury and<br />
clangor of weapons unveiled to the Emperor the true<br />
nature of those unexpected calamities which had so prematurely    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
precipitated the Kalmuck measure.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Apprehending the real state of affairs, the Emperor</span><br />
instantly perceived that the first act of his fatherly care<br />
for these erring children (as he esteemed them), now<br />
returning to their ancient obedience, must be&mdash;to deliver<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 56</span><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>
them from their pursuers. And this was less difficult<br />
than might have been supposed. Not many miles in the<br />
rear was a body of well-appointed cavalry, with a strong<br />
detachment of artillery, who always attended the Emperor's         <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
motions. These were hastily summoned. Meantime<br />
it occurred to the train of courtiers that some danger<br />
might arise to the Emperor's person from the proximity<br />
of a lawless enemy, and accordingly he was induced to<br />
retire a little to the rear. It soon appeared, however, to        <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
those who watched the vapory shroud in the desert, that<br />
its motion was not such as would argue the direction of<br />
the march to be exactly upon the pavilion, but rather in<br />
a diagonal line, making an angle of full 45 degrees with<br />
that line in which the imperial <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> had been standing, <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
and therefore with a distance continually increasing.<br />
Those who knew the country judged that the Kalmucks<br />
were making for a large fresh-water lake about seven or<br />
eight miles distant. They were right; and to that point<br />
the imperial cavalry was ordered up; and it was precisely         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
in that spot, and about three hours after, and at noonday<br />
on the 8th of September, that the great Exodus of the<br />
Kalmuck Tartars was brought to a final close, and with a<br />
scene of such memorable and hellish fury as formed an<br />
appropriate winding up to an expedition in all its parts          <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
and details so awfully disastrous. The Emperor was not<br />
personally present, or at least he saw whatever he <i>did</i> see<br />
from too great a distance to discriminate its individual<br />
features; but he records in his written memorial the<br />
report made to him of this scene by some of his own               <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
officers.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Lake of Tengis, near the frightful Desert of Kobi,</span><br />
lay in a hollow amongst hills of a moderate height, ranging<br />
generally from two to three thousand feet high. About<br />
eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the Chinese cavalry<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 57</span><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>
reached the summit of a road which led through a cradle-like<br />
dip in the mountains right down upon the margin of<br />
the lake. From this pass, elevated about two thousand<br />
feet above the level of the water, they continued to               <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
descend, by a very winding and difficult road, for an hour<br />
and a half; and during the whole of this descent they were<br />
compelled to be inactive spectators of the fiendish spectacle<br />
below. The Kalmucks, reduced by this time from<br />
about six hundred thousand souls to two hundred and               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
sixty thousand, and after enduring for two months and a<br />
half the miseries we have previously described&mdash;outrageous<br />
heat, famine, and the destroying scimiter of the<br />
Kirghises and the Bashkirs&mdash;had for the last ten days<br />
been traversing a hideous desert, where no vestiges were          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
seen of vegetation, and no drop of water could be found.<br />
Camels and men were already so overladen that it was a<br />
mere impossibility that they should carry a tolerable sufficiency<br />
for the passage of this frightful wilderness. On<br />
the eighth day the wretched daily allowance, which had            <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
been continually diminishing, failed entirely; and thus, for<br />
two days of insupportable fatigue, the horrors of thirst<br />
had been carried to the fiercest extremity. Upon this<br />
last morning, at the sight of the hills and the forest<br />
scenery, which announced to those who acted as guides             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
the neighborhood of the Lake of Tengis, all the people<br />
rushed along with maddening eagerness to the anticipated<br />
solace. The day grew hotter and hotter, the people more<br />
and more exhausted; and gradually, in the general rush<br />
forward to the lake, all discipline and command were lost&mdash;all    <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
attempts to preserve a rear guard were neglected&mdash;the<br />
wild Bashkirs rode on amongst the encumbered people<br />
and slaughtered them by wholesale, and almost<br />
without resistance. Screams and tumultuous shouts proclaimed<br />
the progress of the massacre; but none heeded&mdash;none<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 58</span><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>
halted; all alike, pauper or noble, continued to rush<br />
on with maniacal haste to the waters&mdash;all with faces<br />
blackened by the heat preying upon the liver and with<br />
tongue drooping from the mouth. The cruel Bashkir was              <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
affected by the same misery, and manifested the same<br />
symptoms of his misery, as the wretched Kalmuck; the<br />
murderer was oftentimes in the same frantic misery as his<br />
murdered victim&mdash;many, indeed (an ordinary effect of<br />
thirst), in both nations had become lunatic, and in this         <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
state, whilst mere multitude and condensation of bodies<br />
alone opposed any check to the destroying scimiter and<br />
the trampling hoof, the lake was reached; and to that<br />
the whole vast body of enemies rushed, and together<br />
continued to rush, forgetful of all things at that moment         <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
but of one almighty instinct. This absorption of the<br />
thoughts in one maddening appetite lasted for a single<br />
half hour; but in the next arose the final scene of parting<br />
vengeance. Far and wide the waters of the solitary lake<br />
were instantly dyed red with blood and gore: here rode a          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
party of savage Bashkirs, hewing off heads as fast as the<br />
swaths fall before the mower's scythe; there stood unarmed<br />
Kalmucks in a death grapple with their detested foes,<br />
both up to the middle in water, and oftentimes both sinking<br />
together below the surface, from weakness or from                 <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
struggles, and perishing in each other's arms. Did the<br />
Bashkirs at any point collect into a cluster for the sake<br />
of giving impetus to the assault? Thither were the camels<br />
driven in fiercely by those who rode them, generally<br />
women or boys; and even these quiet creatures were                <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
forced into a share in this carnival of murder by trampling<br />
down as many as they could strike prostrate with the<br />
lash of their fore-legs. Every moment the water grew<br />
more polluted; and yet every moment fresh myriads came<br />
up to the lake and rushed in, not able to resist their<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 59</span><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>
frantic thirst, and swallowing large draughts of water,<br />
visibly contaminated with the blood of their slaughtered<br />
compatriots. Wheresoever the lake was shallow enough<br />
to allow of men raising their heads above the water, there,        <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
for scores of acres, were to be seen all forms of ghastly<br />
fear, of agonizing struggle, of spasm, of death, and the<br />
fear of death&mdash;revenge, and the lunacy of revenge&mdash;until<br />
the neutral spectators, of whom there were not a<br />
few, now descending the eastern side of the lake, at length       <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
averted their eyes in horror. This horror, which seemed<br />
incapable of further addition, was, however, increased<br />
by an unexpected incident. The Bashkirs, beginning to<br />
perceive here and there the approach of the Chinese<br />
cavalry, felt it prudent&mdash;wheresoever they were sufficiently      <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
at leisure from the passions of the murderous<br />
scene&mdash;to gather into bodies. This was noticed by the<br />
governor of a small Chinese fort built upon an eminence<br />
above the lake; and immediately he threw in a broadside,<br />
which spread havoc among the Bashkir tribe. As often              <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
as the Bashkirs collected into <i>globes</i> and <i>turms</i> as their<br />
only means of meeting the long line of descending<br />
Chinese cavalry, so often did the Chinese governor of the<br />
fort pour in his exterminating broadside; until at length<br />
the lake, at its lower end, became one vast seething              <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
caldron of human bloodshed and carnage. The Chinese<br />
cavalry had reached the foot of the hills; the Bashkirs,<br />
attentive to <i>their</i> movements, had formed; skirmishes had<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">been fought; and, with a quick sense that the contest was</span><br />
henceforward rapidly becoming hopeless, the Bashkirs              <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
and Kirghises began to retire. The pursuit was not as<br />
vigorous as the Kalmuck hatred would have desired.<br />
But, at the same time, the very gloomiest hatred could<br />
not but find, in their own dreadful experience of the<br />
Asiatic deserts, and in the certainty that these wretched<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 60</span><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>
Bashkirs had to repeat that same experience a second<br />
time, for thousands of miles, as the price exacted by a<br />
retributary Providence for their vindictive cruelty&mdash;not<br />
the very gloomiest of the Kalmucks, or the least reflecting,       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
but found in all this a retaliatory chastisement more<br />
complete and absolute than any which their swords and<br />
lances could have obtained or human vengeance could<br />
have devised.<br /></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Here ends the tale of the Kalmuck wanderings in the</span>              <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Desert; for any subsequent marches which awaited them<br />
were neither long nor painful. Every possible alleviation<br />
and refreshment for their exhausted bodies had been<br />
already provided by Kien Long with the most princely<br />
munificence; and lands of great fertility were immediately        <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
assigned to them in ample extent along the River Ily, not<br />
very far from the point at which they had first emerged<br />
from the wilderness of Kobi. But the beneficent attention<br />
of the Chinese Emperor may be best stated in his own<br />
words, as translated into French by one of the Jesuit             <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
missionaries: "La nation des Torgotes (<i>savoir les Kalmuques</i>)<br />
arriva &agrave; Ily, toute delabr&eacute;e, n'ayant ni de quoi vivre, ni de quoi<br />
se v&ecirc;tir. Je l'avais pr&eacute;vu; et j'avais<br />
ordonn&eacute; de faire en tout genre les provisions n&eacute;cessaires<br />
pour pouvoir les secourir promptement: c'est ce qui a &eacute;t&eacute;         <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
ex&eacute;cut&eacute;. On a fait la division des terres: et on a assign&eacute;<br />
&agrave; chaque famille une portion suffisante pour pouvoir servir<br />
&agrave; son entretien, soit en la cultivant, soit en y nourissant<br />
des bestiaux. On a donn&eacute; &agrave; chaque particulier des &eacute;toffes<br />
pour l'habiller, des grains pour se nourrir pendant l'&eacute;space      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
d'une ann&eacute;e, des ustensiles pour le m&eacute;nage et d'autres<br />
choses n&eacute;cessaires: et outre cela plusieurs onces d'argent,<br />
pour se pourvoir de ce qu'on aurait pu oublier. On a<br />
design&eacute; des lieux particuliers, fertiles en p&acirc;turages; et on<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 61</span><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>
leur a donn&eacute; des boeufs, moutons, etc., pour qu'ils pussent<br />
dans la suite travailler par eux-m&ecirc;mes &agrave; leur entretien et<br />
&agrave; leur bien-&ecirc;tre."<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">These are the words of the Emperor himself, speaking</span>               <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
in his own person of his own paternal cares; but another<br />
Chinese, treating the same subject, records the munificence<br />
of this prince in terms which proclaim still more<br />
forcibly the disinterested generosity which prompted, and<br />
the delicate considerateness which conducted, this extensive      <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
bounty. He has been speaking of the Kalmucks,<br />
and he goes on thus:&mdash;"Lorsqu'ils arriv&egrave;rent sur nos<br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thus, after their memorable year of misery, the Kalmucks</span><br />
were replaced in territorial possessions, and in<br />
comfort equal, perhaps, or even superior, to that which<br />
they had enjoyed in Russia, and with superior political           <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
advantages. But, if equal or superior, their condition<br />
was no longer the same; if not in degree, their social<br />
prosperity had altered in quality; for, instead of being a<br />
purely pastoral and vagrant people, they were now in<br />
circumstances which obliged them to become essentially<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 62</span><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>
dependent upon agriculture; and thus far raised in social<br />
rank that, by the natural course of their habits and the<br />
necessities of life, they were effectually reclaimed from<br />
roving and from the savage customs connected with a half           <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
nomadic life. They gained also in political privileges,<br />
chiefly through the immunity from military service which<br />
their new relations enabled them to obtain. These were<br />
circumstances of advantage and gain. But one great<br />
disadvantage there was, amply to overbalance all other            <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
possible gain: the chances were lost, or were removed to<br />
an incalculable distance, for their conversion to Christianity,<br />
without which in these times there is no absolute<br />
advance possible on the path of true civilization.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">One word remains to be said upon the <i>personal</i> interests</span>    <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
concerned in this great drama. The catastrophe in this<br />
respect was remarkable and complete. Oubacha, with all<br />
his goodness and incapacity of suspecting, had, since the<br />
mysterious affair on the banks of the Torgau, felt his<br />
mind alienated from his cousin; he revolted from the man          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
that would have murdered him; and he had displayed his<br />
caution so visibly as to provoke a reaction in the bearing<br />
of Zebek-Dorchi and a displeasure which all his dissimulation<br />
could not hide. This had produced a feud, which,<br />
by keeping them aloof, had probably saved the life of             <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
Oubacha; for the friendship of Zebek-Dorchi was more<br />
fatal than his open enmity. After the settlement on the<br />
Ily this feud continued to advance, until it came under<br />
the notice of the Emperor, on occasion of a visit which<br />
all the Tartar chieftains made to his Majesty at his hunting      <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
lodge in 1772. The Emperor informed himself accurately<br />
of all the particulars connected with the transaction&mdash;of<br />
all the rights and claims put forward&mdash;and of the<br />
way in which they would severally affect the interests of<br />
the Kalmuck people. The consequence was that he<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 63</span><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>
adopted the cause of Oubacha, and repressed the pretensions<br />
of Zebek-Dorchi, who, on his part, so deeply<br />
resented this discountenance to his ambitious projects<br />
that, in conjunction with other chiefs, he had the presumption     <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
even to weave nets of treason against the Emperor<br />
himself. Plots were laid, were detected, were baffled;<br />
counter-plots were constructed upon the same basis,<br />
and with the benefit of the opportunities thus offered.<br />
Finally, Zebek-Dorchi was invited to the imperial lodge,          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
together with all his accomplices; and, under the skilful<br />
management of the Chinese nobles in the Emperor's<br />
establishment, the murderous artifices of these Tartar<br />
chieftains were made to recoil upon themselves, and the<br />
whole of them perished by assassination at a great imperial       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
banquet. For the Chinese morality is exactly of<br />
that kind which approves in everything the <i>lex talionis</i>:<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"... Lex nec justior ulla est [as <i>they</i> think]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Quam necis artifices arte perire sua."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So perished Zebek-Dorchi, the author and originator of</span>       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
the great Tartar Exodus. Oubacha, meantime, and his<br />
people were gradually recovering from the effects of their<br />
misery, and repairing their losses. Peace and prosperity,<br />
under the gentle rule of a fatherly lord paramount,<br />
redawned upon the tribes: their household <i>lares</i>, after so       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
harsh a translation to distant climates, found again a<br />
happy reinstatement in what had, in fact, been their<br />
primitive abodes: they found themselves settled in quiet<br />
sylvan scenes, rich in all the luxuries of life, and endowed<br />
with the perfect loveliness of Arcadian beauty. But from       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the hills of this favored land, and even from the level<br />
grounds as they approach its western border, they still<br />
look out upon that fearful wilderness which once beheld <span class="pagenum">Page 64</span><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><br />
a nation in agony&mdash;the utter extirpation of nearly half a<br />
million from amongst its numbers, and for the remainder<br />
a storm of misery so fierce that in the end (as happened<br />
also at Athens during the Peloponnesian war from a different       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
form of misery) very many lost their memory; all<br />
records of their past life were wiped out as with a sponge<br />
&mdash;utterly erased and cancelled: and many others lost<br />
their reason; some in a gentle form of pensive melancholy,<br />
some in a more restless form of feverish delirium          <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
and nervous agitation, and others in the fixed forms of<br />
tempestuous mania, raving frenzy, or moping idiocy.<br />
Two great commemorative monuments arose in after<br />
years to mark the depth and permanence of the awe&mdash;<br />
the sacred and reverential grief, with which all persons<br />
looked back upon the dread calamities attached to the       <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
year of the tiger&mdash;all who had either personally shared<br />
in those calamities and had themselves drunk from that<br />
cup of sorrow, or who had effectually been made witnesses<br />
to their results and associated with their relief: two great<br />
monuments; one embodied in the religious solemnity,       <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
enjoined by the Dalai-Lama, called in the Tartar language<br />
a <i>Romanang</i>&mdash;that is, a national commemoration, with<br />
music the most rich and solemn, of all the souls who<br />
departed to the rest of Paradise from the afflictions of the<br />
Desert (this took place about six years after the arrival       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
in China); secondly, another, more durable, and more<br />
commensurate to the scale of the calamity and to the<br />
grandeur of this national Exodus, in the mighty columns<br />
of granite and brass erected by the Emperor, Kien Long,<br />
near the banks of the Ily. These columns stand upon       <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
the very margin of the steppes, and they bear a short but<br />

<h3>THE ORIGINAL SOURCES.</h3>

<br />

<p>In Professor Masson's edition of De Quincey, Vol. VII, p. 8, is the
following discussion of the author's original sources:</p>

<p>"A word or two on De Quincey's authorities for his splendid sketch
called <i>The Revolt of the Tartars</i>:&mdash;One authority was a famous
Chinese state-paper purporting to have been composed by the Chinese
Emperor, Kien Long himself (1735&mdash;1796), of which a French
translation, with the title <i>Monument de la Transmigration des
Tourgouths des Bords de la Mer Caspienne dans l'Empire de la Chine</i>,
had been published in 1776 by the French Jesuit missionaries of Pekin,
in the first volume of their great collection of <i>M&eacute;moires concernant
les Chinois</i>. The account there given of so remarkable an event of
recent Asiatic history as the migration from Russia to China of a
whole population of Tartars had so much interested Gibbon that he
refers to it in that chapter of his great work in which he describes
the ancient Scythians. De Quincey had fastened on the same document as
supplying him with an admirable theme for literary treatment.
Explaining this some time ago, while editing his <i>Revolt of the
Tartars</i> for a set of Selections from his Writings, I had to add that
there was much in the paper which he could not have derived from that
original, and that, therefore, unless he invented a great deal, he
must have had other authorities at hand. I failed at the time to
discover what these other authorities were,&mdash;De Quincey having had a
habit of secretiveness in such matters; but since then an incidental
reference of his own, in his <i>Homer and the Homerid&aelig;</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> has given
me the clue. The author from whom he chiefly drew such of his
materials as were not supplied by the French edition of Kien Long's
narrative, was, it appears from that reference, the German traveller,
Benjamin Bergmann, whose <i>Nomadische Streifereien unter den Kalm&uuml;ken
in den Jahren 1802 und 1803</i> came forth from a Riga press, in four
parts or volumes, in 1804-1805. The book consists of a series of
letters <span class="pagenum">Page 68</span><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>written by Bergmann from different places during his
residence among the Tartars, with interjected essays or dissertations
of an independent kind on subjects relating to the Tartars,&mdash;one of
these occupying 106 pages, and entitled <i>Versuch zur Geschichte der
Kalm&uuml;kenflucht von der Wolga</i> ("Essay on the History of the Flight of
the Kalmucks from the Volga"). A French translation of the Letters,
with this particular Essay included, appeared in 1825 under the title
<i>Voyage de Benjamin Bergmann chez les Kalm&uuml;ks: Traduit de l'Allemand
par M. Moris, Membre de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Asiatique</i>. Both works are now very
scarce; but having seen copies of both (the only copies, I think, in
Edinburgh, and possibly the very copies which De Quincey used), I have
no doubt left that it was Bergmann's Essay of 1804 that supplied De
Quincey with the facts, names, and hints he needed for filling up that
outline-sketch of the history of the Tartar Transmigration of 1771
which was already accessible for him in the Narrative of the Chinese
Emperor, Kien Long, and in other Chinese State Papers, as these had
been published in translation, in 1776, by the French Jesuit
missionaries. At the same time, no doubt is left that he passed the
composite material freely and boldly through his own imagination, on
the principle that here was a theme of such unusual literary
capabilities that it was a pity it should be left in the pages of
ordinary historiographic summary or record, inasmuch as it would be
most effectively treated, even for the purpose of real history, if
thrown into the form of an epic or romance. Accordingly he takes
liberties with his authorities, deviating from them now and then, and
even once or twice introducing incidents not reconcilable with either
of them, if not irreconcilable also with historical and geographical
possibility. Hence one may doubt sometimes whether what one is reading
is to be regarded as history or as invention. On this point I can but
repeat words I have already used: as it is, we are bound to be
thankful. In quest of a literary theme, De Quincey was arrested
somehow by that extraordinary transmigration of a Kalmuck horde across
the face of Asia in 1771, which had also struck Gibbon; he inserted
his hands into the vague chaos of Asiatic inconceivability enshrouding
the transaction; and he tore out the connected and tolerably
conceivable story which we now read. There is no such vivid version of
any such historical episode in all Gibbon, and possibly nothing truer
essentially, after all, to the substance of the facts as they actually
happened."</p>

<p>Professor Masson's Appended Editorial Note on the Chinese Accounts of
the Migration (Vol. VII, pp. 422-6):</p>

<p>"As has been mentioned in the Preface, these appeared, in translated
form, in 1776, in Vol. I of the great collection of <i>M&eacute;moires
concernant <span class="pagenum">Page 69</span><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>les Chinois</i>, published at Paris by the enterprise of the
French Jesuit missionaries at Pekin. The most important of them, under
the title <i>Monument de la Transmigration des Tourgouths des Bords de
la Mer Caspienne dans l'Empire de la Chine</i>, occupies twenty-seven
pages of the volume, and purports to be a translation of a Chinese
document drawn up by the Emperor Kien Long himself. This Emperor,
described by the missionaries as 'the best-lettered man in his
Empire,' had special reasons for so commemorating, as one of the most
interesting events of his reign, the sudden self-transference in 1771
of so large a Tartar horde from the Russian allegiance to his own.
Much of the previous part of his reign had been spent in that work of
conquering and consolidating the Tartar appendages of his Empire which
had been begun by his celebrated grandfather, the Emperor Kang Hi
(1661-1721); and it so chanced that the particular Tartar horde which
now, in 1771, had marched all the way from the shores of the Caspian
to appeal to him for protection and for annexation to the Chinese
Empire were but the posterity of a horde who had formerly belonged to
that Empire, but had detached themselves from it, in the reign of Kang
Hi, by a contrary march westward to annex themselves to the Russian
dominions. The event of 1771, therefore, was gratifying to Kien Long
as completing his independent exertions among the Tartars on the
fringes of China by the voluntary re-settlement within those fringes,
and return to the Chinese allegiance, of a whole Tartar population
which had been astray, and under unfit and alien rule, for several
generations. With this explanation the following sentences from Kien
Long's Memoir, containing all its historical substance, will be fully
intelligible:</p>

<p>"'All those who at present compose the nation of the Torgouths,
unaffrighted by the dangers of a long and painful march, and full of
the single desire of procuring themselves for the future a better mode
of life and a more happy lot, have abandoned the parts which they
inhabited far beyond our frontiers, have traversed with a courage
proof against all difficulties a space of more than ten thousand
<i>lys</i>, and are come to range themselves in the number of my subjects.
Their submission, in my view of it, is not a submission to which they
have been inspired by fear, but is a voluntary and free submission, if
ever there was one.... The Torgouths are one of the branches of the
Eleuths. Four different branches of people formed at one time the
whole nation of the Tchong-kar. It would be difficult to explain their
common origin, respecting which indeed there is no very certain
knowledge. These four branches separated from each other, so that each
became a nation apart. That of the Eleuths, the chief of them all,
gradually <span class="pagenum">Page 70</span><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>subdued the others, and continued till the time of Kang Hi
to exercise this usurped pre-eminence over them. Ts&eacute;-ouang-raptan then
reigned over the Eleuths, and Ayouki over the Torgouths. These two
chiefs, being on bad terms with each other, had their mutual contests;
of which Ayouki, who was the weaker, feared that in the end he would
be the unhappy victim. He formed the project of withdrawing himself
forever from the domination of the Eleuths. He took secret measures
for securing the flight which he meditated, and sought safety, with
all his people, in the territories which are under the dominion of the
Russians. These permitted them to establish themselves in the country
of Etchil [the country between the Volga and the Jaik, a little to the
north of the Caspian Sea].... Oubach&eacute;, the present Khan of the
Torgouths, is the youngest grandson of Ayouki. The Russians never
ceasing to require him to furnish soldiers for incorporation into
their armies, and having at last carried off his own son to serve them
as a hostage, and being besides of a religion different from his, and
paying no respect to that of the Lamas, which the Torgouths profess,
Oubach&eacute; and his people at last determined to shake off a yoke which
was becoming daily more and more insupportable. After having secretly
deliberated among themselves, they concluded that they must abandon a
residence where they had so much to suffer, in order to come and live
more at ease in those parts of the dominion of China where the
religion professed is that of Fo. At the commencement of the eleventh
month of last year [December, 1770] they took the road, with their
wives, their children, and all their baggage, traversed the country of
the Hasaks [Cossacks], skirted Lake Palkach&eacute;-nor and the adjacent
deserts; and, about the end of the sixth month of this year [in
August, 1771], after having passed over more than ten thousand <i>lys</i>
during the space of the eight whole months of their journey, they
arrived at last on the frontiers of Charapen, not far from the borders
of Ily. I knew already that the Torgouths were on the march to come
and make submission to me. The news was brought me not long after
their departure from Etchil. I then reflected that, as Ileton, general
of the troops that are at Ily, was already charged with other very
important affairs, it was to be feared that he would not be able to
regulate with all the requisite attention those which concerned these
new refugees. Chouh&eacute;d&eacute;, one of the councillors of the general, was at
Ouch&eacute;, charged with keeping order among the Mahometans there. As he
found it within his power to give his attention to the Torgouths, I
ordered him to repair to Ily and do his best for their solid
settlement.... At the same time I did not neglect any of the
precautions that seemed to me necessary. I ordered <span class="pagenum">Page 71</span><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>Chouh&eacute;d&eacute; to raise
small forts and redoubts at the most important points, and to cause
all the passes to be carefully guarded; and I enjoined on him the duty
of himself getting ready the necessary provisions of every kind inside
these defences.... The Torgouths arrived, and on arriving found
lodgings ready, means of sustenance, and all the conveniences they
could have found in their own proper dwellings. This is not all. Those
principal men among them who had to come personally to do me homage
had their expenses paid, and were honorably conducted, by the imperial
post-road, to the place where I then was. I saw them; I spoke to them;
I invited them to partake with me in the pleasures of the chase; and,
at the end of the number of days appointed for this exercise, they
attended me in my retinue as far as to G&eacute;-hol. There I gave them a
ceremonial banquet and made them the customary presents.... It was at
this G&eacute;-hol, in those charming parts where Kang Hi, my grandfather,
made himself an abode to which he could retire during the hot season,
at the same time that he thus put himself in a situation to be able to
watch with greater care over the welfare of the peoples that are
beyond the western frontiers of the Empire; it was, I say, in those
lovely parts that, after having conquered the whole country of the
Eleuths, I had received the sincere homages of Tchering and his
Tourbeths, who alone among the Eleuths had remained faithful to me.
One has not to go many years back to touch the epoch of that
transaction. The remembrance of it is yet recent. And now&mdash;who could
have predicted it?&mdash;when there was the least possible room for
expecting such a thing, and when I had no thought of it, that one of
the branches of the Eleuths which first separated itself from the
trunk, those Torgouths who had voluntarily expatriated themselves to
go and live under a foreign and distant dominion, these same Torgouths
are come of themselves to submit to me of their own good will; and it
happens that it is still at G&eacute;-hol, not far from the venerable spot
where my grandfather's ashes repose, that I have the opportunity,
which I never sought, of admitting them solemnly into the number of my
subjects.'</p>

<p>"Annexed to this general memoir there were some notes, also by the
Emperor, one of them being that description of the sufferings of the
Torgouths on their march, and of the miserable condition in which they
arrived at the Chinese frontier, which De Quincey has quoted at p.
417. Annexed to the Memoir there is also a letter from P. Amiot, one
of the French Jesuit missionaries, dated 'Pe-king, 15th October,
1773,' containing a comment on the memoir of a certain Chinese scholar
and mandarin, Yu-min-tchoung, who had been charged by the Emperor with
<span class="pagenum">Page 72</span><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>the task of seeing the narrative properly preserved in four languages
in a monumental form. It is from this Chinese comment on the Imperial
Memoir that there is the extract at p. 418 as to the miserable
condition of the fugitives.</p>

<p>"On a comparison of De Quincey's splendid paper with the Chinese
documents, several discrepancies present themselves; the most
important of which perhaps are these:&mdash;(1) In De Quincey's paper it is
Kien Long himself who first descries the approach of the vast Kalmuck
horde to the frontiers of his dominions. On a fine morning in the
early autumn of 1771, we are told, being then on a hunting expedition
in the solitary Tartar wilds on the outside of the great Chinese Wall,
and standing by chance at an opening of his pavilion to enjoy the
morning sunshine, he sees the huge sheet of mist on the horizon,
which, as it rolls nearer and nearer, and its features become more
definite, reveals camels, and horses, and human beings in myriads, and
announces the advent of, etc. etc.! In Kien Long's own narrative he is
not there at all, having expected indeed the arrival of the Kalmuck
host, but having deputed the military and commissariat arrangements
for the reception of them to his trusted officer, Chouh&eacute;d&eacute;; and his
first sight of any of them is when their chiefs are brought to him, by
the imperial post-road, to his quarters a good way off, where they are
honorably entertained, and whence they accompany him to his summer
residence of G&eacute;-hol. (2) De Quincey's closing account of the monument
in memory of the Tartar transmigration which Kien Long caused to be
erected, and his copy of the fine inscription on the monument, are not
in accord with the Chinese statements respecting that matter. 'Mighty
columns of granite and brass erected by the Emperor Kien Long near the
banks of the Ily' is De Quincey's description of the monument. The
account given of the affair by the mandarin Yu-min-tchoung, in his
comment on the Emperor's Memoir, is very different. 'The year of the
arrival of the Torgouths,' he says, 'chanced to be precisely that in
which the Emperor was celebrating the eightieth year of the age of his
mother the Empress-Dowager. In memory of this happy day his Majesty
had built on the mountain which shelters from the heat (Pi-chou-chan)
a vast and magnificent <i>miao</i>, in honor of the reunion of all the
followers of Fo in one and the same worship; it had just been
completed when Oubach&eacute; and the other princes of his nation arrived at
G&eacute;-hol. In memory of an event which has contributed to make this same
year forever famous in our annals, it has been his Majesty's will to
erect in the same <i>miao</i> a monument which should fix the epoch of the
event and attest its authenticity; he himself composed the words for
<span class="pagenum">Page 73</span><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>the monument and wrote the characters with his own hand. How small
the number of persons that will have an opportunity of seeing and
reading this monument within the walls of the temple in which it is
erected!' Moreover the words of the monumental inscription in De
Quincey's copy of it are hardly what Kien Long would have written or
could have authorized. 'Wandering sheep who have strayed away from the
Celestial Empire in the year 1616' is the expression in De Quincey's
copy for that original secession of the Torgouth Tartars from their
eastern home on the Chinese borders for transference of themselves far
west to Russia, which was repaired and compensated by their return in
1771 under their Khan Oubach&eacute;. As distinctly, on the other hand, the
memoir of Kien Long refers the date of the original secession to no
farther back than the reign of his own grandfather, the Emperor Kang
Hi, when Ayouki, the grandfather of Oubach&eacute;, was Khan of the
Torgouths, and induced them to part company with their overbearing
kinsmen the Eleuths, and seek refuge within the Russian territories on
the Volga. In the comment of the Chinese mandarin on the Imperial
Memoir the time is more exactly indicated by the statement that the
Torgouths had remained 'more than seventy years' in their Russian
settlements when Oubach&eacute; brought them back. This would refer us to
about 1700, or, at farthest, to between 1690 and 1700, for the
secession under Ayouki.</p>

<p>"The discrepancies are partly explained by the fact that De Quincey
followed Bergmann's account,&mdash;which account differs avowedly in some
particulars from that of the Chinese memoirs. In Bergmann I find the
original secession of the ancestors of Oubach&eacute;'s Kalmuck horde from
China to Russia <i>is</i> pushed back to 1616, just as in De Quincey. But,
though De Quincey keeps by Bergmann when he pleases, he takes
liberties with Bergmann too, intensifies Bergmann's story throughout,
and adds much to it for which there is little or no suggestion in
Bergmann. For example, the incident which De Quincey introduces with
such terrific effect as the closing catastrophe of the march of the
fugitive Kalmucks before their arrival on the Chinese frontier,&mdash;the
incident of their thirst-maddened rush into the waters of Lake Tengis,
and their wallow there in bloody struggle with their Bashkir
pursuers,&mdash;has no basis in Bergmann larger than a few slight and
rather matter-of-fact sentences. As Bergmann himself refers here and
there in his narrative to previous books, German or Russian, for his
authorities, it is just possible that De Quincey may have called some
of these to his aid for any intensification or expansion of Bergmann
he thought necessary. My impression, however, is that he did nothing
<span class="pagenum">Page 74</span><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>of the sort, but deputed any necessary increment of his Bergmann
materials to his own lively imagination."</p><a name="EXPLANATORY" id="EXPLANATORY"></a>

<p>1 1. The first three paragraphs of the essay, comprising the formal
introduction, are intentionally rather more picturesque and vivacious
in style than the ordinary narrative that follows. If these paragraphs
be read consecutively aloud, the student will surely feel the sweep
and power of De Quincey's eloquence. Attention may well be directed to
the author's own apparent interest in his subject because of its
appeal to the <i>imagination</i> (p. 1, l. 4), of the <i>romantic
circumstances</i> (p. 1, l. 11), of its <i>dramatic capabilities</i> (p. 2, l.
8), of its <i>scenical situations</i> (p. 3, l. 8). Throughout the essay
effort should be made to excite appreciation of the significance of
words, and De Quincey's mastery in the use of words may be continually
illustrated. In paragraph 1, note the fitness of the word <i>velocity</i>
(l. 12) and the appropriateness of the epithets in <i>almighty
instincts</i> (l. 17), <i>life-withering marches</i> (l. 18), <i>gloomy
vengeance</i> (l. 19), <i>volleying thunders</i> (p. 2, l. 1).</p>

<p>1 5. <b>Tartar.</b> Originally applied to certain tribes in Chinese
Tartary, but here used for Mongolian. Look up etymology and trace
relation of the word to <i>Turk</i>.&mdash;<b>steppes</b>. A Russian word indicating
large areas more or less level and devoid of forests; these regions
are often similar in character to the American prairie, and are used
for pasturage.</p>

<p>1 6,7. <b>terminus a quo, terminus ad quem.</b> The use of phrases quoted
from classic sources is frequent in De Quincey's writings. Note such
phrases as they occur, also foreign words. Is their use to be
justified?</p>

<p>1 18. <b>leeming.</b> The lemming, or leming. A rodent quadruped. "It is
very prolific, and vast hordes periodically migrate down to the sea,
destroying much vegetation in their path."&mdash;<i>Century Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>1 22. <b>Miltonic images.</b> "Miltonic" here characterizes not only images
used by Milton, but images suggestive of his as well. Yet compare:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Or from above</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Should intermitted vengeance arm again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">His red right hand to plague us?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">&mdash;<i>Paradise Lost</i>, II, 172-4.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 14em;">&mdash;<i>Paradise Lost</i>, VI, 139-41.</span><br />
</p>

<p>2 12. <b>sanctions.</b> The word here means not permission, nor recognition
merely, but the avowal of something as sacred, hence obligatory; a
thing ordained.</p>

<p>2 13,14. <b>a triple character.</b> De Quincey is fond of thus analyzing <span class="pagenum">Page 75</span><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>
the facts he has to state. Notice how this method of statement, marked
by "1st," "2dly," "3dly," contributes to the clearness of the
paragraph.</p>

<p>2 17. <b>"Venice Preserved."</b> A tragedy by Thomas Otway, one of the
Elizabethan dramatists (1682).&mdash;<b>"Fiesco."</b> A tragedy by the great
German dramatist Friedrich Schiller (1783), the full title of which is
<i>The Conspiracy of Fiesco at Genoa</i>.</p>

<p>2 22. <b>Cambyses,</b> the Third (529-522 B.C.). He was king of Persia and
led an expedition into Ethiopia, which ended disastrously for him.</p>

<p>2 23. <b>anabasis.</b> The word itself means "a march up" into the
interior.&mdash;<b>katabasis</b> (l. 28) means "a march down,"&mdash;in this case the
retreat of the Greeks. The <i>Anabasis</i> of the Greek historian Xenophon
is the account of the expedition of Cyrus the Younger against
Artaxerxes, which ended with the death of Cyrus at the battle of
Cunaxa (401 B.C.).</p>

<p>2 25. <b>Crassus.</b> A Roman general who led an army into Parthia (or
Persia) (54 B.C.). He was defeated and put to death by
torture.&mdash;<b>Julian</b> (l. 26), the Apostate, lost his life while invading
Persia (363 A.D.).</p>

<p>2 28. <b>the Russian anabasis,</b> etc. The historic invasion of Russia by
the armies of Napoleon in 1812, followed by the terrible retreat from
Moscow.</p>

<p>3 3. <b>This triple character,</b> etc. Note this method of making clear
the connection between paragraphs. Make close study of these
paragraphs; analyze their structure. Compare the manner of introducing
subsequent paragraphs.</p>

<p>3 14. <b>Wolga.</b> The German spelling. The Volga is the longest river in
Europe. It is difficult to locate with certainty all the points here
mentioned.</p>

<p>3 16. <b>Koulagina</b> was a fort somewhere on the Ural river; perhaps to
be identified with Kulaschinskaja, or Kologinskaia.</p>

<p>3 17. <b>Cossacks.</b> A people of mixed origin, but of Russian rather than
Tartar stock. There are two branches, the Ukraine and the Don
Cossacks. This people is first heard of in the tenth century. The
title of the leader was <i>Hetman</i>; the office was elective and the
government was democratic. The Cossacks have been noted always as
fierce fighters and are valuable subjects of the czar. The <i>Bashkirs</i>
(l. 18) are Mongolians and nomadic in their habits.</p>

<p>3 18. <b>Ouchim</b> was evidently a mountain pass in the Ural range
(compare p. 37, l. 18).</p>

<p>3 19. <b>Torgau</b>, spelled also <i>Torgai</i> by De Quincey, though elsewhere <span class="pagenum">Page 76</span><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>
<i>Turgai</i>, indicates a district east of the Ural mountains; it is also
the name of the principal city of that district.</p>

<p>3 20. <b>Khan.</b> A Tartar title meaning chief or governor.</p>

<p>3 22. <b>Lake of Tengis.</b> Lake Balkash is meant. Compare p. 56, l. 18,
and note thereon.</p>

<p>3 23. <b>Zebek-Dorchi.</b> One of the principal characters in the following
narrative.</p>

<p>3 32. <b>Kalmucks.</b> A branch of the Mongolian family of peoples, divided
into four tribes, and dwelling in the Chinese Empire, western Siberia,
and southeastern Russia. They were nomads, adherents of a form of
Buddhism, and number over 200,000.&mdash;<i>Century Cyclopedia of Names.</i></p>

<p>4 12. <b>exasperated.</b> As an illustration of the discriminating use of
words, explain the difference in meaning of <i>exasperated</i> and
<i>irritated</i> (l. 19); also point out the fitness of the word <i>inflated</i>
in the phrase (l. 13).</p>

<p>5 23. <b>rival.</b> Why "<i>almost</i> a competitor"? What is the meaning of
each word?</p>

<p>5 32. <b>odius.</b> Is there any gain in force by adding <i>repulsive</i>?</p>

<p>6 5. <b>Machiavelian.</b> Destitute of political morality. A term derived
from the name of Niccolo Machiavelli, an Italian statesman and writer
(1469-1527), who, in a treatise on government entitled "The Prince,"
advocated, or was interpreted to advocate, the disregard of moral
principle in the maintenance of authority. In this sentence
discriminate between the apparent synonyms <i>dissimulation</i>,
<i>hypocrisy</i>, <i>perfidy</i>.</p>

<p>6 15. <b>Elizabeth Petrowna.</b> Daughter of Peter the Great and Catharine
I. Empress of Russia 1741-1762.</p>

<p>6 28. <b>Tcherkask.</b> An important city of the Cossacks, near the mouth
of the Don.&mdash;<b>tents.</b> A common method of counting families among
nomads. What figure of speech does this illustrate?</p>

<p>7 25. <b>roubles.</b> A rouble is the Russian unit of value, worth
seventy-seven cents. The word is etymologically connected with the
Indian <i>rupee</i>.</p>

<p>7 28. <b>Thus far,</b> etc. Notice the care with which De Quincey analyzes
the situation.</p>

<p>8 19. <b>mercenary.</b> Look up origin of the word. How is it appropriate
here?</p>

<p>8 29. <b>romantic.</b> What are the qualities indicated by this adjective?
How did the word, derived from <i>Roman</i>, get its present significance?</p>

<p>8 34. <b>A triple vengeance.</b> Compare with the similar analysis p. 2, l.
13.</p>

<p>9 11. <b>behemoth</b>. A Hebrew word meaning "great beast." It was <span class="pagenum">Page 77</span><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>
used probably of the hippopotamus. See <i>Job</i>, xl, 15-24. In the work
by Bergmann, which furnished De Quincey with much of his material, the
figure used is that of a giant and a dwarf.&mdash;Muscovy. An old name of
Russia, derived from Moscow.</p>

<p>9 13. <b>"lion ramp."</b> Quoted from Milton:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">The bold Ascalonite</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Fled from his lion ramp.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;<i>Samson Agonistes</i>, 139.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<i>Baptized and infidel</i>" and "<i>barbaric East</i>" are also borrowings
from Milton.</p>

<p>9 16. <b>unnumbered numbers.</b> Notice how effectively in this and the
following sentences De Quincey utilizes <i>suggested</i> words: <i>monstrous,
monstrosity</i>; <i>hopelessness, hope</i>.</p>

<p>9 22. <b>fable.</b> Here used for plot; the idea being that the story of
the Revolt has all the compactness and unity of design to be found in
the plot of a classic tragedy, which could admit the introduction of
no external incidents or episodes to confuse the thread of the main
action.</p>

<p>10 8. <b>translation.</b> Note the etymology of this word, which is here
used in its literal sense.</p>

<p>10 17. <b>But what</b>, etc. See with what art, as well as with what
evident interest, De Quincey catches the very spirit of the plot. How
does the interrogation add strength?</p>

<p>10 25, 26. <b>Kien Long.</b> "Emperor of China from 1735 to 1796, was the
fourth Chinese emperor of the Mantchoo-Tartar dynasty, and a man of
the highest reputation for ability and accomplishment."&mdash;MASSON.</p>

<p>10 28. <b>religion.</b> Lamaism. "A corrupted form of Buddhism prevailing
in Tibet and Mongolia, which combines the ethical and metaphysical
ideas of Buddhism with an organized hierarchy under two semi-political
sovereign pontiffs, an elaborate ritual, and the worship of a host of
deities and saints."&mdash;<i>Century Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>10 29. <b>Chinese Wall.</b> This famous wall was built for defence against
the northern Mongols in the third century. It is 1400 miles in length
and of varying height. In what sense is the phrase used figuratively?</p>

<p>11 17. <b>great Lama.</b> "Lama, a celibate priest or ecclesiastic
belonging to that variety of Buddhism known as Lamaism. There are
several grades of lamas, both male and female. The dalai-lama and the
tesho-or bogdo-lama are regarded as supreme pontiffs. They are of
equal <span class="pagenum">Page 78</span><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>authority in their respective territories, but the former is
much the more important, and is known to Europeans as the Grand
Lama,"&mdash;<i>Century Dictionary.</i></p>

<p>The Dalai-Lama (p. 12, l. 11) resides at Lassa in Tibet.</p>

<p>12 34. <b>With respect to the month.</b> Notice the extreme care with which
the author develops the following details, and the touch of sympathy
with which this paragraph closes.</p>

<p>13 28. <b>war raged.</b> "The war was begun in 1768 when Mustapha III. was
Sultan of Turkey; and it was continued till 1774."&mdash;MASSON.</p>

<p>13 33. <b>Human experience</b>, etc. It is a favorite device of this writer
to develop a concrete fact into an abstraction of general application.
Do you believe that this is true? Can you give any illustration?</p>

<p>15 1. <b>a pitched battle.</b> "It will be difficult, I think, to find
record, in the history of the Russo-Turkish war of 1768, of any battle
answering to this."&mdash;MASSON.</p>

<p>15 10. <b>Paladins.</b> A term used especially to designate the famous
knightly champions who served the Frankish Charlemagne. Look up the
etymology of the word and trace its present meaning.</p>

<p>15 24. <b>ukase.</b> "An edict or order, legislative or administrative,
emanating from the Russian government."&mdash;<i>Century Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>16 9. <b>mummeries.</b> Find the original meaning of this word.</p>

<p>16 22. <b>Catharine II.</b> "Elizabeth had been succeeded in 1762 by her
nephew Peter III., who had reigned but a few months when he was
dethroned by a conspiracy of Russian nobles headed by his German wife
Catharine. She became Empress in his stead, and reigned from 1762 to
1796 as Catharine II."&mdash;MASSON.</p>

<p>17 10. <b>doubtful suspicion and indirect presumption.</b> Note the
additional force given to the nouns by the adjectives.</p>

<p>17 18. <b>Weseloff.</b> This gentleman is referred to again at more length
in pages 45-50.</p>

<p>17 31. <b>sanctions.</b> Compare the note on p. 2, l. 12. The sense in
which the word is used justifies the use of <i>violate</i> in the next
line.</p>

<p>18 24. <b>first of all.</b> Again see how, by use of this phrase, followed
later by <i>secondly</i>, <i>thirdly,</i> etc., De Quincey gains greater
clearness for his various points.</p>

<p>19 29. <b>But the time</b>, etc. Here is the first general division point
in the main narrative. The genesis of the plot has been described; now
follow the active preliminaries to the flight.</p>

<p>19 33. <b>one vast conflagration.</b> Compare the account, p. 25.</p>

<p>20 12, 13. <b>But where or how</b>, etc. Note again the effective use of
interrogation. How does it stimulate interest?</p>

<p>20 17. <b>Kirghises.</b> The spelling <i>Kirghiz</i> is more familiar. Like the
  <span class="pagenum">Page 79</span><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>Bashkirs, nomads of
the Mongolian-Tartar race, perhaps the least civilized of those
inhabiting the steppes.</p>

<p>20 26. <i>rhetoric.</i> In what sense used here? Is this use correct?</p>

<p>21 5. <i>Sarepta.</i> Locate this town; it is on a small river that empties
into the Volga. "The point of the reference to this particular town is
that it was a colony of industrious Germans, having been founded in
1764 or 1765 by the Moravian Brothers."&mdash;BALDWIN.</p>

<p>22 11. <b>Temba.</b> The Jemba.</p>

<p>22 28. <b>Kichinskoi.</b> Notice the vividness of the character portrait
that follows; compare it with the portraitures of Zebek and Oubacha
previously given.</p>

<p>23 1. <b>surveillant.</b> Here used for watchman or spy. What derivatives
have we from this French expression?</p>

<p>23 34. <b>Christmas arrived.</b> Another division point in the analysis.</p>

<p>24 5. <b>Astrachan.</b> Also spelled <i>Astrakhan</i>. The name of a large and
somewhat barren district comprising more than 90,000 square miles of
territory in southeastern Europe; its capital city, having the same
name, is situated on the Volga near its mouth.</p>

<p>24 26. <b>at the rate of 300 miles a day.</b> By no means an incredible
speed; in Russia such sledge flights are not uncommon. Compare what De
Quincey has to say of the glory of motion in <i>The English
Mail-Coach</i>,&mdash;"running at the least twelve miles an hour."</p>

<p>25 26. <b>malignant counsels.</b> What is the full effect of this epithet?</p>

<p>26 10. <b>valedictory vengeance.</b> Note again the force of the epithet.</p>

<p>26 28. <b>aggravate.</b> What is the literal significance of this word? As
synonymous with what words is it often incorrectly used?</p>

<p>28 11. <b>For now began to unroll.</b> Does this paragraph constitute a
digression, or is it a useful amplification of the narrative? Does De
Quincey exaggerate when he terms these experiences of the Tartars "the
most awful series of calamities anywhere recorded"?</p>

<p>28 14. <b>sudden inroads.</b> "The inroads of the Huns into Europe extended
from the third century into the fifth; those of the Avars from the
sixth century to the eighth or ninth; the first great conquests of the
Mongol Tartars were by Genghis-Khan, the founder of a Mongol empire
which stretched, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, from
China to Poland."&mdash;MASSON.</p>

<p>28 18. <b>volleying lightning.</b> Compare p. 2, l. 1, where De Quincey
uses a somewhat similar phrase. Why is the phrase varied, do you
suppose?</p>

<p>28 21. <b>the French retreat.</b> It would be interesting to <span class="pagenum">Page 80</span><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>
compare the incidents and figures of this retreat, as furnished by
biographers and historians. Sloane's <i>Life of Napoleon</i> is a recent
authority.</p>

<p>28 26. <b>vials of wrath.</b> Compare <i>Revelation</i>, xv, 7, and xvi, 1. If
De Quincey had used the Revised Version he would have written <i>bowls</i>
instead of <i>vials</i>. Such borrowings of phrase or incident are called
"allusions." Make a list of the scriptural allusions found in the
essay,&mdash;of those suggested by Milton.</p>

<p>29 16. <b>Earthquakes.</b> "De Quincey here refers to such destructive
shocks as that which occurred at Sparta, 464 B.C., in which, according
to Thirlwall, 20,000 persons perished; that which Gibbon speaks of
during the reign of Valentinian, 365 A.D., in which 50,000 persons
lost their lives at Alexandria alone; that in the reign of Justinian,
526 A.D., in which 250,000 persons were crushed by falling walls;
others in Jamaica, 1692 A.D.; at Lisbon, 1755 A.D., with loss of
30,000 lives; and in Venezuela, 1812 A.D., when Caraccas was
destroyed, and 20,000 souls perished."&mdash;WAUCHOPE.</p>

<p>29 20. <b>pestilence.</b> Described by Thucydides; see also Grote's
<i>History of Greece</i>, Chap. XLIX. Of the great plague of London (1665)
the most realistic description is Defoe's <i>Journal of the Plague
Year</i>.</p>

<p>29 28. <b>The siege of Jerusalem.</b> Read Josephus, <i>The Jewish War</i>, Bks.
V and VI.</p>

<p>29 31. <b>exasperation.</b> Compare note on p. 26, l. 28.</p>

<p>30 3, 4. <b>even of maternal love.</b> The reference is to an incident
mentioned by Josephus (<i>The Jewish War</i>, Bk. VI, Chap. III), in which
a mother is described as driven by the stress of famine to kill and
devour her own child.</p>

<p>30 5. <b>romantic misery.</b> How <i>romantic</i>? Compare this phrase with
similar uses of the word <i>romantic</i>.</p>

<p>30 10. <b>River Jaik.</b> The Ural.</p>

<p>30 33. <b>scenical propriety.</b> Compare the statement with similar ones
made by the author elsewhere.</p>

<p>31 11. <b>decrement.</b> Compare with its positive correspondent,
<i>increment</i>.</p>

<p>31 20. <b>acharnement.</b> Fury.</p>

<p>31 26. <b>The first stage</b>, etc. A time mark in the essay.</p>

<p>32 10. <b>liable.</b> Another instance of a word often misused, correctly
employed in the text. Compare note on <i>aggravate</i>, p. 26, l. 28.</p>

<p>32 23. <b>Bactrian camels.</b> There are two species of camel, the
dromedary, single humped, and the Bactrian, with two humps. The former
is native to Arabia, the latter to central Asia. The dromedary is the

now called Balkh, in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>33 7. <b>evasion.</b> Compare with its positive correspondent <i>invasion</i>;
compare <i>decrement</i>, p. 31, l. 11.</p>

<p>34 8. <b>champaign savannas.</b> Both words mean about the same, an open,
treeless country, nearly level. What is the linguistic source of both
words?</p>

<p>37 19. <b>hills of Moulgaldchares.</b> Spurs of the Urals running
southwest.</p>

<p>38 10. <b>Polish dragoons.</b> "The adjective refers not to the
nationality, but to the equipment of the cavalry. Thus there was at
one time in the French army a corps called <i>Chasseurs d'Afrique</i>, and
in both the French and that of the Northern troops in our own Civil
War a corps of Zouaves. Similarly at p. 53, l. 24, De Quincey speaks
of <i>yagers</i> among the Chinese troops. Perhaps both Polish dragoon and
yager were well-known military terms in 1837. At any rate there is no
gain in scrutinizing them too closely, since the context in both cases
seems to be pure invention."&mdash;BALDWIN.</p>

<p>38 11. <b>cuirassiers.</b> From the French. Soldiers protected by a
cuirass, or breastplate, and mounted.</p>

<p>38 20. <b>River Igritch.</b> The Irgiz-koom.</p>

<p>39 21. <b>concurrently.</b> Etymology?</p>

<p>39 33. <b>sad solitudes</b>, etc. Notice this as one of the points in a
very effective paragraph.</p>

<p>40 3. <b>aggravations.</b> Compare note on p. 26, l. 28.</p>

<p>40 5. <b>howling wilderness.</b> Why so called? Compare with a previous use
of the same expression (p. 12, l. 5).</p>

<p>40 18. <b>spectacle.</b> Compare with other references to the theatrical
quality of the <i>Flight</i>.</p>

<p>40 21. <b>myriads.</b> Is this literal? Notice the contrast in tone between
this sentence and those which close the paragraph.</p>

<p>41 12. <b>adust.</b> "Latin, <i>adustus</i>, burned. Looking as if burned or
scorched."&mdash;<i>Century Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>41 15. <b>erected their speaking eyes.</b> Study this expression until its
forcefulness is felt. The camel is notorious for its unresponsive
dullness; indeed its general apathy to its surroundings is all that
accounts for its apparent docility. De Quincey, therefore, is speaking
by the book when he describes these brutes as "without the affections
or sensibilities of flesh and blood." Their very submissiveness is due
to their stupidity.</p>

<p>41 20. <b>those of Xerxes.</b> See Crete's <i>History of Greece</i>, Chap.
XXXVIII.</p>

<p>41 29. <b>untread.</b> A dictionary word, but uncommon. Recall
<span class="pagenum">Page 82</span><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>
similar words used by De Quincey which add picturesqueness in part
because of their novelty.</p>

<p>41 31. <b>their old allegiance.</b> 1616. See the close of this paragraph.</p>

<p>41 33. <b>scapegoat.</b> <i>Leviticus</i>, xvi, 7-10; 20-22.</p>

<p>42 32, 33. <b>land of promise ... house</b>, etc. <i>Deuteronomy</i>, viii, 14;
ix, 28.</p>

<p>43 8. <b>Orsk.</b> Upon the river Or.</p>

<p>43 9. <b>Oriembourg.</b> A fort.</p>

<p>43 23. <b>sinister.</b> Etymology?</p>

<p>43 29. <b>transpiring.</b> Like <i>aggravate</i> and <i>liable</i>, a word often
misused. What does it mean?</p>

<p>44 10. <b>were dispersed.</b> Note the variety of phrases in the following
ten lines used to indicate separation.</p>

<p>46 16. <b>Hetman.</b> Chief. Compare Germ. <i>Hauptmann</i>, Eng. <i>captain</i>, Fr.
<i>chef</i>.</p>

<p>47 1. <b>evasion.</b> See previous note on p. 33, l. 7.</p>

<p>48 2. <b>carabines.</b> Old-fashioned spelling. Short rifles adapted to the
use of mounted troops.</p>

<p>49 13. <b>without a parallel.</b> As has been seen, De Quincey is fond of
superlative statements. A writer may or may not be true in his claims;
the habitual assumption, however, predisposes his reader to doubt his
judgment.</p>

<p>49 16. <b>Desultors.</b> This word is not in common use, but <i>desultory</i>
is. Look up the derivation and note the metaphor concealed in the
latter word.</p>

<p>49 19. <b>at the rate of 200 miles.</b> Compare preceding note on p. 24, 1.
26.</p>

<p>50 27. "<b>more fell</b>," etc. From the last speech in Shakespeare's
Othello, addressed to Iago:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">O Spartan dog,</span><br />
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!<br />
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;<br />
This is thy work.<br />
</p>

<p>51 17. <b>"fierce varieties."</b>. Misquoted. See <i>Paradise Lost</i>, II, 599;
VII, 272.</p>

<p>51 19. <b>post equitem</b>, etc.:</p>

<p>
Behind the horseman sits black care.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;Horace's <i>Odes</i>, III, 1, 40.</span><br />
</p>

<p>51 20. <b>undying worm.</b> <i>Isaiah</i>, lxvi, 24.</p>

<p>51 29. <b>"from morn till dewy eve."</b> Paradise Lost, I, 742. <span class="pagenum">Page 83</span><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></p>

<p>52 33. <b>On a fine morning.</b> Study this paragraph carefully with
reference to the rhetorical effect. The entire scene is the product of
De Quincey's imagination; do you consider it truthful?</p>

<p>53 24. <b>yagers.</b> German <i>J&auml;ger</i>; used of a huntsman or a forester,
also in parts of Germany and Austria used to indicate light infantry
or cavalry. Compare with <i>Polish dragoons</i>, p. 38, l. 10.</p>

<p>54 21. <b>indorsed.</b> Look up the etymology. Has De Quincey, in his note,
quoted Milton accurately? See <i>Paradise Regained</i>, III, 329.</p>

<p>56 13. <b>rather in a diagonal.</b> This is another characteristic of De
Quincey; he is sometimes tediously exact in his details; perhaps the
minuteness is justifiable in this instance, as the statement increases
the realistic effect of an imaginary scene.</p>

<p>56 18. <b>a large fresh-water lake.</b> The Lake of Tengis here referred
to, mentioned by name in the paragraph following this, is evidently
Lake Balkash, into which flows the river Ily. It is one of the largest
lakes in the steppes, but its water is really <i>salt</i>.</p>

<p>59 21. <b>globes and turms.</b> Latinisms. Milton uses <i>globe</i> in <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, II, 512, and <i>turms</i> in <i>Paradise Regained</i>, IV, 66.</p>

<p>60 4. <b>retributary.</b> What more common form is used synonymously?</p>

<p>60 21. <b>"La nation des Torgotes,"</b> etc. "'The nation of the Torgouths
(<i>to wit the Kalmucks</i>) arrived at Ily wholly shattered, having
neither victuals to live on [<i>sic</i>] nor clothes to wear. I had
foreseen this, and had given orders for making every kind of
preparation necessary for their prompt relief; which was duly done.
The distribution of lands was made; and there was assigned to each
family a portion sufficient to serve for its support, whether by
cultivating it or by feeding cattle on it [<i>sic</i>]. There were given to
each individual materials for his clothing, corn for his sustenance
for the space of one year, utensils for household purposes, and other
things necessary; besides some ounces of silver wherewith to provide
himself with anything that might have been forgotten. Particular
places were marked out for them, fertile in pasture; and cattle and
sheep, etc., were given them, that they might be able for the future
to work for their own support and well-being.'&mdash;This is a note of Kien
Long subjoined to his main narrative; and De Quincey, I find, took the
above transcript of it from the French translation of Bergmann's book.
That transcript, it is worth observing, is not quite exact to the
original French text of the Pekin missionaries."&mdash;MASSON.</p>

<p>61 12. <b>"Lorsqu'ils arriv&egrave;rent,"</b> etc. "'When they arrived on our
frontiers (to the number of some hundreds of thousands, although
<span class="pagenum">Page 84</span><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>
nearly as many more had perished by the extreme fatigue, the hunger,
the thirst, and all the other hardships inseparable from a very long
and very toilsome march), they were reduced to the last misery, they
were in want of everything. The Emperor supplied them with everything.
He caused habitations to be prepared for them suitable for their
manner of living; he caused food and clothing to be distributed among
them; he had cattle and sheep given them, and implements to put them
in a condition for forming herds and cultivating the earth; and all
this at his own proper charges, which mounted to immense sums, without
counting the money which he gave to each head of a family to provide
for the subsistence of his wife and children.'</p>

<p>"This is from a eulogistic abstract of Kien Long's own narrative by
one of his Chinese ministers, named Yu Min Tchoung, a translation of
which was sent to Paris by the Jesuit missionary, P. Amiot, together
with the translation of the imperial narrative itself. The transcript
is again by the French translator of Bergmann, and is again rather
inaccurate."&mdash;MASSON.</p>

<p>63 17. <b>lex talionis.</b> Law of retaliation.</p>

<p>63 18. <b>"lex nec justior,"</b> etc. "Nor is there any law more just than
that the devisers of murder should perish by their own device."&mdash;OVID,
<i>Ars Amatoria</i>, I, 655.</p>

<p>63 25. <b>lares.</b> The minor deities of a Roman household.</p>

<p>63 30. <b>Arcadian beauty.</b> Arcadian is synonymous with rural simplicity
and beauty. Arcadia, the central province of Greece, was a pastoral
district and lacked the vices&mdash;as well as some of the virtues&mdash;of the
surrounding states.</p>

<p>64 1. <b>extirpation.</b> Etymology?</p>

<p>64 23. <b>music.</b> One who has listened to Mongolian attempts at harmony
must suspect that De Quincey is again inspired by his imagination when
he characterizes this part of the commemoration as "rich and solemn."</p>

<p>64 28. <b>columns of granite and brass.</b> This feature of the narrative,
as well as many other details of apparent fact, including the entire
inscription said to have been placed upon the monument, are evidently
the pure invention of De Quincey's fancy, no mention of these details
being found in his historical sources.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
